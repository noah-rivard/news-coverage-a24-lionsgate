# Final Output Template

This file is appended automatically after each successful pipeline run.
Set `FINAL_OUTPUT_PATH` to override the destination during tests or alternative deployments.

Layout notes:
- Keep the buyers list in square brackets, even when there is only one match.
- Keep the publish timestamp in ISO 8601 inside parentheses to avoid timezone confusion.
- Each `Category:` block has a `Content:` bullet list (even when there is only one item) to avoid ambiguous parsing.
- In `Content:` bullets, append the article date as a Markdown link to the article: `([M/D](URL))`.
- If a `Content:` bullet already contains a bare date like `(M/D)` anywhere in the text, link it to the article URL as `([M/D](URL))` (don’t leave dates unlinked).
