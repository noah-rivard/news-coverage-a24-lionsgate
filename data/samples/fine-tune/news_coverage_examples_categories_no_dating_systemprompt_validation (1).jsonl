Moore is back at Sony Pictures Television, signing a multi-year overall deal with the independent studio. Under the pact, Moore, his Tall Ship Productions banner, and longtime collaborators Maril Davis and Ben McGinnis will develop and produce scripted series for cable and streaming platforms. Moore left Sony in 2020 after a successful 10-year run that yielded two long-running, hit series, Outlander for Starz and For All Mankind for Apple TV+. Four years later, the dramas he developed/co-created are still going and both have become franchises, spawning upcoming spinoffs, Blood of My Blood and Star City, respectively. Moore serves as an executive producers on the mothership series and the offshoots. Under his previous Sony TV deals, Moore also executive produced two other projects that went to series, anthology Philip K. Dick’s Electric Dreams for Prime Video, which he also co-developed, and Helix for Syfy. Watch on Deadline “This is a true homecoming, and I couldn’t be more excited to be reunited with Ron at Sony,” said Katherine Pope, President, Sony Pictures Television Studios. “Ron is an unbelievable storyteller. He knows how to connect with audiences through the characters and worlds he builds – characters and worlds that are brilliant, beautiful, rich, and authentic. The shows he has created alongside the incomparable Maril Davis remain relevant, watched, and admired by millions of fans worldwide, and we can’t wait to see which new places they will pull us into next.” When he moved to 20th Television in 2020, Moore was attracted by the opportunity to work with the Disney cannon. He developed multiple projects, including a Swiss Family Robinson series reboot and The Society of Explorers and Adventurers, set in the Magic Kingdom Universe, for Disney+ as well as A Court Of Thorns And Roses adaptation for Hulu, neither of which has come to fruition. “I’m incredibly happy to return home to Sony Pictures Television. Creating shows with the team there has been enormously gratifying, and I’ve always been impressed by their enthusiasm and commitment to making great shows,” Moore said. “I’ve known and admired Katherine since we first worked together at Universal, and I’m really excited for us to work together again to make great television.” Before signing a deal at Sony TV in 2010, Moore was based at NBCUniversal’s TV studio where Pope was a programming executive and subsequently president. While there, Moore created the reimagined Battlestar Galactica. He served as executive producer and showrunner on the 2003 series, which received a Peabody Award and earned Moore a drama writing Emmy nomination and an Emmy win for the Battlestar Galactica webisodes. The deal brings one of Sony TV’s most accomplished creators/showrunners of the past two decades back into the fold as another one, Shawn Ryan, is leaving for a pact with Netflix. The indie studio has been bulking up its talent roster over the past couple of months, signing overall/first-look deals with Gail Berman, Jessi Klein, Third Rail, Steve Lightfoot and Judalina Neira. Sci-fi veteran Moore got his start on the writing staff of Star Trek: The Next Generation where he wrote or co-wrote 27 episodes, including the two-hour series finale, for which he won a Hugo Award in 1994. That same year, he joined the writing staff of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Moore served briefly as executive consultant on the USA Network series Good vs. Evil before joining the staff of Roswell as executive producer, taking over as showrunner in its final season. He also served as executive producer and showrunner of HBO’s Carnivàle before segueing to Battlestar Galactica.

In order to win, they must figure out their mystery locations. Once they’re on the blacked-out Destination X bus, the journey transforms into a real-life game board, with challenges designed to offer clever clues as to their location, along with a few misdirects to keep them guessing. At the end of each episode, contestants must guess where they are and the furthest from the actual location is sent packing. The first participant to reach Destination X will be crowned the winner. With high stakes and mind-blowing spectacular gameplay, the series will keep viewers engaged and take them along for the ride.” “‘Destination X’ captivated me with its blend of travel, mystery, and gaming,” Morgan added. “I can’t wait to embark on this wild guessing game across the globe as Master of Ceremony, navigating players through challenges that test their mental and physical abilities.” Morgan currently stars in the AMC series “The Walking Dead: Dead City,” in which he reprises the role of Negan, whom he began playing in “The Walking Dead” back in 2016.

Andy Cadman and Lee Smithurst will executive produce alongside Twofour managing director Dan Adamson and chief creative director David Clews. Twofour director of production and operations Shireen Abbott will oversee production. Morgan will also executive produce in addition to hosting. “Destination X” marks the second commission between NBC and the BBC following “The Traitors.” Twofour will produce both versions.

Deborah Norville hosts the strip, which will launch in fall 2025 on CBS-owned stations — which includes the major New York, Los Angeles and Chicago markets. “The Perfect Line” was developed with the pitch that stations could potentially pair it with CBS Media Ventures’ recent new game show “The Flip Side,” hosted by Jaleel White. Following that show’s launch this year, Wendy McMahon, president and CEO of CBS News and Stations, as well as CBS Media Ventures, said the distributor “found the daytime audience continues to have a huge appetite for and engagement with game shows. “We’re building on that success by bringing ‘The Perfect Line’ to the marketplace, with a host everyone already knows and admires,” McMahon added. “Deborah is a natural hosting this show – her wit and charm resonate with audiences. We are confident ‘The Perfect Line’ will be the perfect fit for stations’ lineups.” Popular on Variety A pilot to “The Perfect Line” was shot in August. The trivia game includes questions about from world events, pop culture, sports, science and other topics. Contestants are given a category and then arrange events, items or people order — such as arranging six actors in the order of their worldwide box office gross. Winners are able to create “the perfect line” via that correct order, and try not to be eliminated after every round. The last person standing plays a final round for a chance at $10,000. “I grew up watching way too many game shows and have always wanted to do one,” Norville said. “With ‘The Perfect Line,’ I’ve found the right format. The show is a fast, fun, smart take on trivia and pop culture with tidbits of stuff you didn’t know – and it’s played in a way that you’ve got a chance to win even if you’re just guessing.

But the third-party titles will only be available for a limited time. Apple TV+’s lineup has mostly comprised original series, movies and specials commissioned for the platform (as well as a smattering of live MLB games). Now it has added a bouquet of older film favorites to the mix, including popular and award-winning movies like “Titanic,” “300,” “Argo,” “Black Hawk Down,” “The Bodyguard,” “Jurassic World,” “Gravity,” “Fast & Furious 6,” “Kill Bill” Volume 1 and 2, “Star Trek Into Darkness,” “The Wolf of Wall Street,” “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” “Mad Max: Fury Road,” the original 2004 “Mean Girls” and “Zoolander.” The movies are listed in a new section on the service labeled “Great Movies on Apple TV+” — however, the service notes, these are available for a “limited time.” Many of the titles are set to roll off later in March, with some available through the end of April. It doesn’t appear that Apple TV+ will be adding a regular rotation of licensed films going forward: The service added the big batch of movies for 2024 Oscars season, as a celebration of filmdom and movie stars (and to spotlight some of the actors in Apple TV+ originals). Popular on Variety To be clear, Apple TV+ has in fact offered some licensed titles previously on a very selective basis. For example, it included a small group of films starring Jennifer Lawrence tied to last year’s premiere of “Causeway.” In addition, Apple TV+ hosted a collection of films starring Sidney Poitier for a limited time to celebrate to the 2022 launch of the “Sidney” feature documentary. Apple TV+ debuted in November 2019, originally priced at just $4.99 per month in the U.S. The company hiked the price for new and existing subscribers in October 2022 to $6.99 per month, then raised it a year later to $9.99 per month. It’s worth noting that Netflix grew to its current colossal scale on the back of third-party programming, and even as it has invested more into originals it continues to offer a healthy bucket of licensed content (as do other top streaming platforms). The addition of the licensed titles to Apple TV+ was spotted by podcaster Sigmund Judge of MacStories’ “Magic Rays of Light.” Here’s the list of movies Apple TV+ can stream as part of their subscription — at least for now: - 21 Jump Street - 300 - The Accountant - American Sniper - Argo - Bad Boys - Black Hawk Down - The Bodyguard - Captain Phillips - Catch Me If You Can - Con Air - Draft Day - Edge of Tomorrow - Failure to Launch - Fast & Furious 6 - Fast Five - Ferris Bueller’s Day Off - Fight Club - Good Burger - Gravity - Horrible Bosses - How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days - The Hurt Locker - I Am Legend - Jurassic World - Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom - Kill Bill: Volume 1 - Kill Bill: Volume 2 - Knocked Up - Mad Max: Fury Road - Mean Girls (2004) - Men in Black - Minority Report - No Strings Attached - The Prestige - The Proposal - Old School - Saving Private Ryan - Spider-Man - Spider-Man 2 - Star Trek - Star Trek Beyond - Star Trek Into Darkness - Titanic - Training Day - Troy - Two Weeks Notice - The Wolf of Wall Street - Wyatt Earp - Zodiac - Zombieland - Zoolander"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strategy & Miscellaneous News -> General News & Strategy -> Strategy"}]}

Such Brave Girls follows Josie (Kat Sadler), her sister Billie (Lizzie Davidson) and their mum Deb (Louise Brealey), as they attempt to claw their way towards a better life. Per the synopsis: “Armed only with an ability to see the line and boldly step over it, these very brave girls finally have a chance to explore themselves.” Season 1 of the show launched last year, as a loosely autobiographical story about dysfunctional family life. Sadler and her real-life sister Davidson star. Further casting and launch details on the six-part season 2 will follow. Watch on Deadline Such Brave Girl’s writer and creator Kat Sadler recently picked up a BAFTA Craft award for Emerging Talent, Fiction. “It’s a sick pleasure that these horrible characters get to live another day and I’m now contractually obliged put them through hell again,” she said. “The BBC are masochists and I’m very grateful.” The show, which is challenging for a BAFTA at this Sunday’s TV Awards, is a VAL production for BBC Three and BBC iPlayer, and Hulu.

Netflix, for instance, eliminated new sign-ups for its cheapest ad-free plan last year, but is only just beginning to funnel existing users off the tier. A sober cost-benefit analysis is necessary in these situations: How much of that audience will be lost if forced off their current plan, versus upgraded to either a more expensive plan or a more lucrative ad-supported tier? For Netflix, it’s likely that the majority of the users at stake will be retained. But the same cannot be said for Peacock, which has its own backlog of legacy users — and a much larger one, proportionally speaking. SEE ALSO: Netflix Ad Plan May Have 20+ Million U.S. Subs While Peacock had about 34 million paid subscribers as of Q1 2024, fully a third of Peacock’s total user base was still on the service’s free tier as of Q1, according to exclusive results from the latest quarterly streaming survey by HarrisX, even though new sign-ups for the no-cost plan were shut off over a year ago. Peacock launched in 2020 with a free option it proudly touted; its early marketing slogan was “Free as a Bird.” But the streamer later opted to cut off new free users in light of mounting losses (and Wall Street’s souring attitude on the economics of streaming) and stopped reporting the “monthly active user” metric that included free tier subscribers. As those losses have continued to pile up — with $639 million more last quarter, according to parent Comcast’s recent earnings report, Peacock has now lost about $8.5 billion since launch — its leadership must be considering whether a push to convert the free-tier users to paid subscribers would be worthwhile. Though these users are still generating some amount of ad revenue for Peacock, it’s clearly not enough to put the service on track to hit profitability in the near future. Pushing users from a free plan to a paid plan rather than pushing them to accept ads is a much taller order, however, particularly for a service not called Netflix. Peacock’s share of U.S. TV viewing time in March was just 1.3%, versus Netflix’s 8%, according to Nielsen’s monthly “Gauge” report, and hit original series on the platform have been few and far between. Furthermore, even among its paid subscribers, usage is sparse; the HarrisX survey found only 24% of Peacock Premium users streamed content on the platform on a daily basis. Admittedly, this was on par with most of Peacock’s fellow legacy-media streamers, and even Big Tech player Amazon Prime Video, which also notched 24% daily usage. But with such a large audience now accustomed to viewing it for free, Peacock will have a difficult road ahead to grow its paid user base even if the free tier is shut down completely.

The deal was blessed Sunday by a special committee of Paramount’s board of directors, a person familiar with the matter told Deadline. A formal announcement is expected as soon as Monday morning. Bloomberg News earlier Sunday was the first to report on the special committee vote. Reps from NAI, Paramount and Skydance did not immediately respond to Deadline’s request for comment. While the board committee action is a milestone, one of the features of the current agreement is a 45-day “go-shop” provision, which allows NAI chief Shari Redstone to field alternative offers. Apollo Global Management, Barry Diller and Edgar Bronfman Jr. are among those who have explored bids. Apollo, both on its own and in partnership with Sony Pictures, has submitted formal offers in recent months but they haven’t gained much traction. Watch on Deadline Under terms of the Skydance agreement, Redstone and her family will receive $1.75 billion, with additional funds going toward Paramount debt repayment. The transaction is expected to be the first of two parts, with a full merger between Skydance and Paramount Global to follow. NAI controls nearly 80% of Paramount’s Class A, or voting, shares. It holds only about 10% of its equity value, with that disparity adding to the complexity of deal negotiations in recent months. Skydance is a longtime partner with Paramount Pictures as a co-financier on marquee franchises like Mission: Impossible, Star Trek, Transformers and Top Gun. Along with the 112-year-old movie studio, Skydance will gain control of a portfolio including CBS, Nickelodeon and Paramount+. Unlike other bidders aiming to break up the company, Skydance is seen as wanting to preserve the entity in much the same shape as it currently exists, though there will undoubtedly be significant cost cutting. That strategic vision helps explain Redstone’s longtime preference for Skydance over some other suitors, according to sources familiar with the deal talks. Less than a month ago, it seemed that any hope of the parties reaching a deal had evaporated. Redstone pulled out of a planned deal at the 11th hour over concerns regarding her net proceeds and exposure to shareholder lawsuits. While earlier Skydance overtures caused Paramount’s already battered stock to sink even lower due to concerns about shareholder dilution, the most recent go-round has boosted the share price. In Hollywood and media circles, the Paramount M&A watch has punctuated a period marked by existential anxiety and fears emerged of another major studio poised to disappear in the wake of Fox’s absorption by Disney. Ellison and his backers (reportedly including his father, billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison) were undaunted by Redstone’s last-minute reversal in June. Parting with the media empire built by her father, Sumner Redstone, has never been an easy process. Shari Redstone, after taking the reins a decade ago as Sumner Redstone’s health declined, succeeded with signature initiative, bringing Viacom and CBS back under the same corporate umbrella after multiple attempts. The merger of the companies into what is now Paramount Global closed in December 2019. The triumph of shepherding the merger turned out to be short-lived, with Covid and numerous other difficulties piling up as two companies became one. Today, Paramount faces considerable challenges on many fronts. The company, which is a fraction of the size of top media rivals Disney and Comcast, is straining to make a profit in streaming as it confronts secular declines in its linear TV business and an unsettled moviegoing climate. While Paramount shares have enjoyed an uptick on the merger news, they are still worth less than one-third what they were when Viacom and CBS came together. As the company has explored various M&A scenarios, it has also jettisoned longtime CEO Bob Bakish in favor of a tripartite Office of the CEO consisting of veteran execs George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins. At the company’s annual shareholder meeting and a subsequent town hall with employees last month, the execs laid out their strategy, which consists of reducing expenses (targeting $500 million in annual cost savings), maximizing the asset portfolio and exploring streaming partnerships or joint ventures. Just before the most recent Skydance news broke last week, there were reports of Paramount in talks to sell BET and discussing a streaming partnership with a third party. “While we recognize that this is not a traditional management structure, we are confident that it will enable them to move quickly to implement best practices throughout the company and to drive improved performance,” Redstone said at the annual meeting. As the Office of the CEO gets set to pass the baton (former NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell is waiting in the wings as part of the Skydance bid), yet another round of downsizing will reshape the company’s workforce. At the end of 2023, the company had 21,900 full- and part-time employees. “We’d like to take a moment to acknowledge the challenges of all the M&A speculation surrounding our company,” Robbins said during the town hall. “We know what a difficult and disruptive period it has been. And while we cannot say that the noise will disappear, we are here today to lay out a go-forward plan that can set us up for success no matter what path the company chooses to go down.” Dominic Patten contributed to this report."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "M&A -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Owner Weigel Broadcasting Co. announced Wednesday that it will launch MeTV Toons as a new national TV network focused on classic animation, “from Hollywood-era shorts to made-for-television favorites.” MeTV Toons, which launches June 25, is a collab between Weigel and Warner Bros. Discovery, which has licensed content featuring its animated characters including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Scooby Doo, Tom & Jerry, George Jetson, Top Cat, Yogi Bear, Popeye, Johnny Quest and Fred Flintstone. (MeTV already airs a daily program, “Toon In With Me,” which features a heavy emphasis on Warner bros. animated fare.) Weigel touts MeTV Toons as “the only TV network destination dedicated exclusively to classic animation” — as Warner Bros. Discovery’s Cartoon Network companion Boomerang, which also runs old Looney Tunes, “The Jetsons,” “The Flintstones,” “Scooby-Doo” and Popeye shorts, also runs some more recent, post-2000 cartoon episodes. Popular on Variety Beyond Warner Bros. titles, MeTV Toons will also feature animated content from other studios and distributors, with properties including Rocky and Bullwinkle, Woody Woodpecker, Casper, Betty Boop and Speed Racer. “We are honored to work with the amazing team at Warner Bros. Discovery and others on this network and bring together a truly incredible collection of the world’s best known and most loved classic cartoons, creating a new destination for everyone to discover or rediscover the sheer joy of watching cartoons on TV,” said Weigel vice chairman Neal Sabin. “MeTV Toons will be dedicated 24/7 to showcasing the biggest names and most beloved classic cartoons and animated characters. Everyone has a favorite cartoon; it is a universally loved art form. We are thrilled to bring those smiles and memories back to TV with MeTV Toons.” Sabin added in an executive briefing on Wednesday: “The cartoons offered are going to help make this be the greatest animation network ever. Everybody has a favorite cartoon — just just think about the cartoons that you watched when you were younger and the nice warm, fuzzy feelings that they bring back. We’re going to bring those back to people every day in the MeTV way of doing things and this network is going to appeal to all ages and advertisers. It’s going to be multi-studio, multi-platform and multi-generational. It’s MeTV Toons, and it’s going to be really special.” As part of the channel launch, animation historian Jerry Beck (whose books include “The 50 Greatest Cartoons,” “The Hanna-Barbera Treasury” and “Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies: A Complete Illustrated Guide to Warner Bros. Cartoons”) will help produce original content related to the MeTV Toons library. Also, character actor Bob Bergen — who has voiced Porky Pig, Marvin the Martian and more, will serve as the signature voice announcer for MeTV Toons. MeTV Toons will be available for distribution on over-the-air broadcast television, traditional and virtual operators, along with a complimentary offering for ad-supported streaming services. Besides MeTV and MeTV Toons, other Weigel networks include Heroes & Icons, Start TV, Catchy Comedy, Movies!, Story Television, Dabl and MeTV+. “Neal and the team at Weigel have been long-standing and innovative licensing partners of Warner Bros. content for decades,”, said David Decker, president of content sales for Warner Bros. Discovery, in a statement. “Having some of the Studio’s most iconic animated characters all available in one place is not only great for fans of classic animation, but also just super fun.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> TV -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Judge Bruce G. Iwasaki granted Netflix’s motion to throw out the lawsuit Tuesday, finding that the diver, Pipin Ferreras, could not prove that the fictional film was about him. “No Limit” was released on Netflix in September 2022. It tells a story “inspired by real events” of a couple, Pascal Gautier and Roxana Aubrey, who engage in free diving, plunging to extreme depths without an oxygen supply. Roxana dies on a record attempt, with the clear implication that Pascal has sabotaged her equipment. Ferreras sued for defamation last year, alleging that the film amounted to an accusation that he had killed his wife. Audrey Mestre drowned during a free dive in 2002. Ferreras, who supervised the dive, has since faced intense criticism over his safety practices. Popular on Variety Ferreras is never mentioned in the movie, which includes a standard disclaimer that it is a work of fiction and that “any resemblance with reality is coincidental.” However, the film ends with a tribute to Mestre, displaying a title card with her photo and a one-sentence account of her death. Netflix filed a motion to throw out the lawsuit in November, arguing that while the film was inspired, in part, by Mestre’s story, it was not meant to be a literal account of her death. The writer-director, David M. Rosenthal, said in a court declaration that he learned of Mestre’s story by watching an ESPN documentary; he then read more articles and books about the case. But Rosenthal said he was also inspired by “Le Grand Bleu,” a 1988 film about rival free divers directed by Luc Besson, as well as by films and novels depicting dangerous romantic relationships. “The film was not intended to depict any particular person, but rather explores my imaginings of how a particularly toxic relationship might unravel in a unique, high-pressure environment like the world of no limit free diving,” Rosenthal wrote. Rosenthal said that, like everyone else, he does not know the true cause of Mestre’s death and did not intend to weigh in on that controversy. He said he included the tribute to Mestre to honor her, but not to indicate that the film depicted her life story. He also argued that the film’s ending is “intentionally vague,” as the viewer is left to decide whether Pascal killed Roxana or not. “The drama created by uncertainty is far greater than any created by an obvious villain,” he wrote. The judge disagreed with that, finding there was no ambiguity about whether the character of Pascal was to blame. But Iwasaki also held that Pascal was not the real-life Ferreras — and that therefore the film is not defamatory. “No reasonable viewer would find that the Film portrayed Plaintiff,” the judge wrote. Iwasaki wrote that many of the parallels between the movie and Ferreras’ life story would be common to any movie about free diving. And he found significant differences, noting that the abusive and controlling relationship depicted in the film bears no resemblance to Ferreras’ account of a harmonious marriage. Ferreras’ attorney, Alexander Rufus-Isaacs, said he would appeal. He has argued there are 22 similarities between the fictional portrayal and the true story, making it abundantly clear that the film is about his client. “I think this is one of the strongest libel-in-fiction cases I’ve come across,” he said. Rufus-Isaacs has also sued Netflix on behalf of real-life figures represented in “Inventing Anna” and “The Queen’s Gambit.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strategy & Miscellaneous News -> General News & Strategy -> Misc.

The U.K.-based company, which commissions international productions and co-productions for Disney’s linear networks as well as streaming platform Disney+, reported revenues of £86 million ($110 million) for the year ending in Sept 2023, according to the latest financial report filed at U.K. business registrar Companies House last week. The figure marks a drop from the previous year’s reported revenue of £215 million ($270 million), which covered the year ending Oct. 2022 and marked an all-time high for the subsidiary. In the year ending Oct. 2021 – which was the first financial reporting year following the launch of Disney+ in the U.K. — the company reported revenues of £43 million. Popular on Variety According to the accompanying financial report, the subsidiary’s directors are “in the process of considering the company’s future” although for now they expect it to continue trading. The report also noted that the decrease in revenue is because “production work on most titles has completed.” A rep for Disney EMEA told Variety: “Disney remains committed to creating quality storytelling, and our award-winning original local productions on Disney+ across EMEA, such as U.K. comedy ‘Extraordinary’ and Italian drama ‘The Good Mothers,’ are a testament to that. We have a fantastic slate of productions coming too in the months ahead, including ‘Becoming Karl Lagerfeld’ and ‘Rivals.’” In fairness, Walt Disney EMEA Productions Limited’s figures don’t necessarily paint the whole picture — Disney’s U.K. operation includes dozens more standalone subsidiary companies it uses for international productions, meaning not all productions go through Walt Disney EMEA Productions Limited. But the company’s financial report does note that some of the biggest risks facing the company are changes to U.K. and Europe-wide economic conditions as well as “substantial competition from alternative providers” That seems to correspond with the shift in strategy that accompanied CEO Bob Iger’s return to the Mouse House at the end of 2022. Following the launch of Disney+ in the U.K. in March 2020, a boom in local commissioning saw most of the big streaming platform enter an arms race for content, with players such as Disney+, Apple TV+, Netflix and Prime Video rushing to produce a glut of local content for local markets. Some of it paid off, with shows such as Netflix’s “Bridgerton,” Apple TV+’s “Slow Horses” and Disney+’s docu-series “Coleen Rooney: The Real Wagatha Story.” But there were also a number of flops, including Disney+’s U.K. original series “Wedding Season” and “The Full Monty” sequel. Following “the Netflix correction” that saw Wall Street focus on the streamers’ bottom lines rather than subscriber numbers, many streamers have since reigned in their production spend and begun selling some of their original shows. Disney+ recently licensed U.K. original comedy “Extraordinary” to local networks for further windowing opportunities. Earlier this month Iger explicitly stated that the company was reducing output on Disney+ particularly for Marvel titles. “We’re slowly going to decrease volume and go to probably about two TV series a year instead of what had become four and reduce our film output from maybe four a year to two, or a maximum of three,” the Disney CEO said during the company’s quarterly earnings call. “And we’re working hard on what that path is.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> International -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Along with its monthly The Gauge report, Nielsen debuted a Media Distribution report on Tuesday that assesses cross-platform TV consumption by media company. The Walt Disney Company took the top spot, accounting for 11.5% of total TV viewing. About 42% of that share was attributable to Disney+ and Hulu, Nielsen reported. YouTube came in second place with a 9.6% share of TV in April. It’s worth nothing that, naturally, all of YouTube’s viewing comes from streaming. The platform is consistently the highest ranked in terms of streaming share each month, and April was no different. It came in far above Netflix’s 7.6% share, which put that streamer in second place for streaming. But, as Nielsen is pointing out with its latest report, streaming still doesn’t tell the entire story.

Watch on Deadline Even though Prime Video was in eighth place with a 3.2% share of TV viewing (also completely from streaming), it still managed to have a breakout month thanks to the release of Fallout, which was Amazon’s most successful program to date and topped all other streaming titles in the month of April.

The top broadcast telecast in April by a wide margin was the NCAA women’s basketball championship with more than 17M viewers. The drama genre accounted for 29% of broadcast viewing, driven by Tracker, NCIS and Young Sheldon on CBS, and Chicago Fire and Chicago Med on NBC.

Discovery in the U.S. — but it’s a whole different story in Africa. The streaming stalwart, a dominating SVOD force in huge swaths of the world, has been surpassed in Africa by the continent’s most popular streaming service: Showmax, which launched in South Africa in 2015. As of November 2023, Netflix had 1.8 million subscribers in Africa, according to research firm Omdia, trailing the 2.1 million signed up to Showmax, which has seen its sub base surge 60% just since 2021. What has fueled the rise of Showmax in Africa can be traced back to an exclusive licensing deal made in 2020 that gave the streaming service exclusive rights to WBD subsidiary HBO programming in the region, followed by an even bigger coup in March 2023, when Showmax’s parent company, MultiChoice, formed a deal with Comcast to acquire a 30% stake in Showmax through NBCUniversal and Sky. The partnership has since proven successful, granting viewers access to international hits from Peacock in addition to a strong preexisting catalog of Max, Sony and Hulu that deliver award-winning shows such as “The White Lotus” and “The Last of Us.” Just last week, Paramount+ was added to the mix, with its own partnership deal to launch a branded hub on Showmax. Last month, MultiChoice received a buyout offer from Vivendi’s Canal+ Group. The French company originally bought stock in MultiChoice in 2020 and has acquired up to 31% as of February 2023. This newest offer was at a 40% premium equivalent to $1.64 billion, but it was rejected by the media giant. Instead, MultiChoice plans to pump an additional $89 million into Showmax by March. NBCUniversal has also said it will be contributing $177 million to the platform over the next year. This will serve as fuel for the streaming platform’s ambitious goal to reach 50 million subscribers and $1 billion in revenue over the next five years. But the heart of Showmax’s success comes from maintaining a focus on locally produced content. In the past year, MultiChoice spent roughly $1 billion on African film and TV, covering half of its general entertainment budget. In return, Showmax pumped out 20 originals in February alone and is expected to have over 1,300 hours of original content produced by the end of the year — representing a 150% increase in output since 2022. And the strategy is working, as the majority of the top streamed shows for the platform for 2023 were African produced, including “The Real Housewives of Nairobi” — an extension of the behemoth reality franchise — or the Kenyan drama series “Single Kiasi,” which is about to enter season two. Just last month, Showmax added rights to the English Premier League. Not only is soccer the most viewed sport in the world, but Africa boasts a particularly rabid fan base. This perfect partnership proves a valuable asset to combat Netflix, which recently announced its own partnership with WWE. Since launching in Africa in 2016, Netflix has invested $175 million on content as of 2022. The platform has also struck partnerships with African filmmakers to accurately represent regional stories, a strategy that has not only attracted African subscribers but given creators opportunities to reach viewers outside the continent. For instance, “Blood & Water,” a drama series based in Cape Town, reached the top of the charts in the U.S. and was renewed for its fourth season. Nigerian action thriller “The Black Book” has also scored worldwide success, spending three weeks among Netflix’s top 10 English-language titles in the world. In September, the streamer announced its newest slate at MIP Africa, including the second season of “Savage Beauty” and spy thriller feature “Heart of the Hunter,” set to hit the platform later this year. In 2023, Africa reached over 8 million subscribers in the SVOD space, per Digital TV Research, which predicts it will reach 18 million by 2029, while the company also estimates Netflix will make a comeback and surpass Showmax by that time, reaching 7.55 million subs to Showmax’s 4.4 million. But while Africa is one of the fastest-growing regions on the planet, Digital TV Research expects its broadband penetration to be relatively low, pegged at just 7.7%. Still, the growth spurt of 8 million to 18 million it’s anticipated to hit over the next five years makes the continent a pocket worth targeting at a time when other territories are maturing. U.S. SVOD subscription growth plummeted from 21.6% in 2022 to 10.1% in 2023, according to new data out this week from research firm Antenna. Prime Video entered Africa in 2016 but finished November 2023 with only 300,000 subscribers. The platform has since decided to refocus on European content and drastically reduced funding in Africa. Other players, such as AppleTV+ and Disney+, joined in 2019 and 2022, respectively, though neither has made much of a dent. Showmax’s success being fleeting may reflect the fact that it had to slash its subscription fee by nearly 50%, a short-term strategy to prioritize attracting more subscribers before inevitably having to raise its price to similar to what Netflix charges. The idea of succeeding in the fastest-growing continent is alluring, but the complex African market is costly and difficult to navigate. Inconsistencies surrounding payment and broadband, as well as curating culturally relevant content lead to high entry barriers for new competitors. So for now, it’s a two-horse race between Showmax and Netflix, with Showmax taking the lead, however briefly."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> International -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Written by Katie Rose Rogers, The Grays is a contemporary take on the Oscar Wilde classic about our fascination with eternal youth set against the backdrop of the modern beauty industry. In a twist on the gothic novel, the series revolves around siblings Basil and Doran Gray. Fittingly, two of the project’s executive producers are siblings Katie Rose Rogers (Supergirl) and Robbie Rogers (All American), who worked together on the Emmy-nominated limited series Fellow Travelers.

After Dorian sells his soul, Basil paints a portrait of him that ages and gets distorted while Dorian — keeping his youthful, beautiful looks — descends into self-indulgent sensualism and hedonism and eventually kills Basil, along with others who try to intervene. The book has been the subject of numerous feature and TV adaptations. Mimoun is coming off serving as executive producer and showrunner on Berlanti Prods.’ Max series The Girls On The Bus.

The eight-part family comedy series will be set in a haunted country house full of hilarious new ghosts who are as chaotic, unpredictable and messy as Australian history itself. No cast or creative talent has been disclosed, nor a production schedule. However, the companies said that the completed show would air in 2025. Popular on Variety The original series “Ghosts” was produced by Monumental Television in association with Them There for BBC One. It was distributed by BBC Studios. The fifth and final series of the original U.K. version was the most-watched comedy in 2023, with the finale watched by over 6 million people in seven days. The U.S. version is in production with its fourth season for CBS. It is produced by CBS Studios in association with Lionsgate Television and BBC Studios Los Angeles Productions and is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution. A German version of “Ghosts” was recently announced. “’Ghosts’ has been a smash hit in the UK and US and has also attracted a very loyal fanbase here in Australia. With a stellar cast yet to be announced, we can’t wait to bring to life our very own series with an Aussie twist,” said Daniel Monaghan, SVP content & programming, Paramount Australia. The two companies described the premise of the local adaptation. “New lovebirds Kate and Sean are about to jump into the hellscape that is the inner-city rental market, until Kate inherits a huge mansion in the country.

Putting their political feet on the gas, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) and Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) want a response by the end of the month, and they want the Department of Justice looped in. “The Joint Venture raises questions about how this new offering would affect access, competition, and choice in the sports streaming market,” wrote Nadler, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, and Castro, a longtime guardian of antitrust issues in the media, to the trio of CEOs today (read it here). “Without more complete information about the pricing, intent, and organization of this new venture, we are concerned that this consolidation will result in higher prices for consumers and less fair licensing terms for upstream sports leagues and downstream video distributors.” The request that the DOJ be cc’d on all the responses due by April 30 from Disney, Fox and WBD definitely raises the stakes. Watch on Deadline As you can see below, the Democrats sent list of 19 questions about the potential anticompetitive nature of the “Joint Venture.” Specifically, Nadler and Castro want to know how it will work, cost, bid on contracts, license sports channels and what they plan to do “to prevent anti-competitive sharing of pricing or other competitively sensitive information” – AKA: Open the books. Mr. Robert Iger Jerrold Nadler Chief Executive Officer The Walt Disney Company Mr. Lachlan Murdoch Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer FOX Mr. David Zaslav Chief Executive Officer Warner Bros. Discovery Dear Mr. Iger, Mr. Murdoch, and Mr. Zaslav: We write to request information about the proposed sports streaming joint venture (“the Joint Venture”) your companies announced in February. While streaming has transformed the way Americans access most media content over the past decade, the live sports distribution space has remained relatively static. Still, live sports events including the Super Bowl and the NCAA’s March Madness tournament accounted for 97 of the top 100 most-watched TV broadcasts in 2023. In a recent CNBC appearance, The Walt Disney Company’s CFO, Hugh Johnson, stated that your companies collectively control 80 percent of this content market. As programmers, your companies exert tremendous influence over pricing across the live sports TV ecosystem. Upstream, programmers negotiate content licensing deals with sports leagues like the National Football League and the National Basketball Association for the media rights to their sports events. Downstream, programmers determine the terms on which video distributors may license programmers’ sports channels. Historically, distributors have primarily been multi- channel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as the cable and satellite television companies Comcast, DISH, and DirecTV. In the era of streaming, distributors have expanded to include virtual multi-channel video programming distributors (“virtual MVPDs” or “vMVPDs”) that provide services over the internet, such as YouTubeTV, fuboTV, and Sling. As a result, the Joint Venture raises questions about how this new offering would affect access, competition, and choice in the sports streaming market. Without more complete information about the pricing, intent, and organization of this new venture, we are concerned that this consolidation will result in higher prices for consumers and less fair licensing terms for upstream sports leagues and downstream video distributors. To improve our understanding of the Joint Venture, we respectfully request answers to the following questions by April 30, 2024. Please copy the Department of Justice in your response. 1. What are the relevant markets impacted by the Joint Venture? 2. How many subscribers is the Joint Venture projected to have within 1, 3, and 5 years of launch? 3. Will the Joint Venture distribute channels of non-joint venture partners? 4. How will the Joint Venture Partners determine the pricing of their own sports channels (e.g., Fox Sports, ESPN) included in the Joint Venture? 5. How do those prices compare to prices at which such channels are currently licensed to third-party MVPDs or virtual MVPDs? 6. Will the Joint Venture Partners implement provisions to prevent anti-competitive sharing of pricing or other competitively sensitive information among each other? 7. What measures will the Joint Venture Partners implement to prevent interlocking directorates? 8. When will the pricing of the Joint Venture be determined and announced? 9. What League Properties does each Joint Venture Partner currently hold the rights to, where “League Property” means a content licensing agreement with any of the following: the NFL, the NBA, the MLB, the NHL, the NCAA Basketball Tournament, NCAA Football (by major league) and NCAA Basketball (Men’s and Women’s). What League Properties to licensors other than the Joint Venture Partners hold the rights to? 10. For each of the sports channels that will be included in the new service, how many hours of live events for League Properties does the channel transmit per calendar year? 11. To what extent will customers be offered opportunities to bundle other products offered by the Joint Venture partners with the Joint Venture? Will Joint Venture customers be offered the opportunity to bundle the Joint Venture with direct-to-consumer products of third parties? 12. Will the Joint Venture Partners offer stand-alone streaming sports services? If the Joint Venture Partners decide to offer independent offerings from the Joint Venture, how will firewalls be implemented to ensure there is no collusion between the Joint Venture and their independent streaming sports offers? 13. The Joint Venture Partners currently bid against each other for sports content. However, the new venture will be pooling sports content among the Joint Venture Partners. Will the Joint Venture Partners continue to bid competitively against one another for sports rights as they become available? 14. Will the Joint Venture Partners make the channels they include in the Joint Venture available to third parties on non-discriminatory terms? 15. Will the Joint Venture partners negotiate jointly with MVPDs to license sports channels? Also, with virtual MVPDs? 16. Will the Joint Venture Partners continue to require that MVPDs and virtual MVPDs purchase other programming in addition to their sports channels as a condition of their licensing agreements? Will the Joint Venture Partners continue to require penetration minimums for their sports and other channels when negotiating with MVPDs and other virtual MVPDs? 17. The companies propose to engage in a form of vertical integration, leveraging their content assets into a virtual MVPD. In previous transactions involving vertical integration between programmers and MVPDs (e.g., Comcast-NCBU, AT&T-Time Warner), the parties made certain commitments to submit licensing negotiations to binding arbitration. Will joint venture partners make similar commitments? 18. Prior to negotiation of the Joint Venture, what standalone plans had each of the Joint Venture Partners considered for making their sports channels available via streaming, including but not limited the launch of a new virtual MVPD or inclusion in the Joint Venture Partner’s existing streaming service (e.g., Disney+ or MAX). 19. Do you anticipate the joint venture will be required to make a filing with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act? Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we look forward to your answers to these questions. Sincerely, United States Representative Joaquin Castro United States Representative Disney, Fox and Warner Bros Discovery did not respond to our request for comment on the Congressmen’s letter. If they do, we will update this post. As it stands, the charges of potential anticompetitive behavior in today’s letter from Rep Nadler and Rep. Castro are not the first to be levied against the February 6 announced sports bundle, which some industry wags have nicknamed “Spulu” after another joint venture, the original Hulu. Fubo, which operates a sports-focused pay-TV service, has filed suit against the JV participants, with CEO David Gandler calling them a “cartel” engaged in “borderline racketeering” Apart from the regulatory dimension, there are questions about the potential scale of the offering, which lacks key sports rights holders Paramount Global and NBCUniversal. Hinting the new service could cost more than $50 a month, Murdoch also said last month at a Wall Street conference that the company anticipates drawing 5 million subscribers in the first five years of the venture. That level would qualify the Pete Distad-led service as a marginal player, not the category killer envisioned by some rivals and regulators. Lacking original streaming content, at least initially, the so-called “Spulu” will meld together 14 linear network feeds from Disney, Fox and WCD to provide pre-licensed NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB coverage. Noteworthy, that neither Paramount nor NBCUniversal are on board with Disney, Fox and WBD on this joint venture. Presenting the biggest possible challenge to the status quo, Netflix has joined fellow streamers Amazon Prime Video and AppleTV+ in getting into live sports.

LuckyChap and Vertigo Entertainment will produce alongside Electronic Arts’ The Sims team, with Herron and Redman serving as exec producers. Developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts, The Sims allows players to create and control virtual people called “Sims,” who live in a simulated world where they engage in everyday activities such as socializing, working, building homes, and forming relationships. The gameplay is open-ended and sandbox-style, giving players the freedom to shape their Sims’ lives without any set objectives or storylines. Since its debut in 2000, The Sims has became one of the best-selling video game series of all time, with nearly 200 million copies sold globally. The game’s most recent expansion pack, The Sims 4: Lovestruck, released this past July.

He has found one. CNN — CNN? — will on Saturday launch Wood as host of “Have I Got News For You,” the U.S. version of a U.K. comedy mainstay. In “News,” two teams of comedians, newsmakers, actors and media personalities use news clips and headlines to drum up jokes and gags, all improv-style, though a round of different segments. Amber Ruffin, the actor and late-night writer, and Michael Ian Black, an actor, improv comedian and author, will serve as team captains each week. One element that might bring the show broader appeal, says Wood, is the desire to get newsmakers — even polarizing ones — to take part. “In America, we’re not always the biggest fans of the ‘bad person’ being given the microphone,” but “above all, this is about laughing and we got who to say what?” says Wood. “And if we can get those two things to connect every week, then I think we will have a product that is going to be on the air for a very long time.” Popular on Variety CNN may serve as the backdrop for any number of “Saturday Night Live” sketches, but the Warner Bros. Discovery network isn’t known in and of itself for being particularly humorous. Over the years, however, its executives have tested programming with a decidedly lighter tone. In 2008 and 2009, CNN ran a program led by comedian D.L. Hughley. The CNN documentary series “United Shades of America” was hosted by W. Kamau Bell, the comedian and activist who did a prior stint at FX and FXX hosting a weekly comedy series. In 2019, CNN gave some time to Colin Quinn for a one-time special. Because “Have I Got News For You” has aired on the BBC since 1990, executives at CNN felt comfortable bringing it to their schedule, says Amy Entelis, executive vice president for talent and content at CNN. “It has been in the hands of very experienced people” who will have oversight of the U.S. version, she says during an interview. “We felt we could take our shot at this and our audience will give us the permission to try.” CNN has already greased the path. The network has been airing Bill Maher’s HBO program, “Real Time” on Saturdays for months, getting viewers accustomed to the idea of profanity, pointed comments and satire. Entelis says the program brings new audiences to CNN on Saturdays. Besides, Fox News Channel has already tested comedy and found it successful; the network runs not only a Saturday comedy show hosted by Jimmy Failla, but a primetime roundtable led by Greg Gutfeld that is one of its most-watched programs. Viewers have grown accustomed to seeing guests with shocking backgrounds on comedy shows, says Wood. Even “SNL” brings on a guest every once in a while who spurs debate. In the recent past, executive producer Lorne Michaels has given the nod to hosts such as Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Dave Chapelle and Shane Gillis. “It would be nice to have an Eric Adams type, or a Ted Cruz type, who can come on and be OK with being jabbed and hey, swing back,” says Wood. “If you don’t like it, you know, you have an open space, an opportunity to throw something back. That’s ultimately what I would like to see this show become.” Saturday nights are not TV’s most watched. Broadcast networks tend to fill their primetime hours with repeats and college football. Entelis says CNN faced similar challenges on Sundays in 2013 when it decided to fill its schedule with documentary series that featured Anthony Bourdain, among others. That has grown into a signature part of CNN’s programing base. Maher and Wood “could help establish a different mood for Saturday night,” she says. Getting this type of opportunity is among the reasons Wood cites for departing “Daily.” “This was the type of scenario I was hoping for,” he says, and he believed exiting ahead of an election year made for a smart strategy. “If there was a good opportunity for me, I believed it would happen in an election year, not after,” he notes. Comedic news has flourished, but usually not on the news outlets. People have embraced “The Daily Show,” “Last Week Tonight” with John Oliver and the “Weekend Update” segment of “SNL.” When subscribers to Max, the streaming hub owned by Warner, choose the “news” section, they are offered access to past episodes of Oliver’s and Maher’s HBO series, along with the choice to stream CNN. Getting CNN viewers to grab hold shouldn’t be too difficult, says Wood. “This idea that comedy and news can’t coexist? I think it’s a myth.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> News -> General News & Strategy"}]}

One of them, “Vampirina,” is based on the children’s books by Anne Maria Pace and inspired by the Disney Jr. animated series from Chris Nee.

The other series, “How We Became the Biggest Band in the World,” follows three members of a famous pop group, Electric Bloom, as they reminisce and tell the story of their band and friendship, starting with the day they met in middle school. According to the logline, “the girls go on a journey to becoming the biggest band in the world and the best friends in the universe.” Popular on Variety Both “Vampirina” and “How We Became the Biggest Band in the World” are working titles. “Vampirina” stars newcomer Kenzi Richardson as Vee, Jiwon Lee (“Rise Up, Sing Out”) as Sophie, Shaun Dixon (“The Neighborhood”) as Elijah, Milo Maharlika (“Les Miserables” Broadway National Tour) as Demi and newcomer Faith Hedley (Disney’s “The Lion King” international tour) as Britney.

Moya-Smith was also overseeing Wrecking Crew, the Dave Bautista and Jason Momoa buddy action comedy from Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto. The executive was part of the film teams overseen by Courtenay Valenti and Julie Rapaport.

Our players are: Jinx Alameda, a bounty hunter at the top of her game who’s tired of her grimy life; Goldfish, a charming con man and wanted felon who falls head over heels for Jinx; and Columbia, Goldfish’s loose-cannon partner, who has big criminal dreams. Their paths join when they’re pulled into a search for missing mob money — a payout so big that it lures them away from the familiar streets of Cleveland, into a dangerous, unpredictable misadventure that will change the course of their lives. “Jinx” is executive produced by Bendis along with showrunners Ayelet Waldman and Michael Chabon (“Star Trek: Picard,” “Unbelievable”). Popular on Variety Set in an alternate world where five families never lost their stranglehold on the country, “Murder Inc.” follows Valentine Gallo, a newly “made man” whose first task for the mob ends with an explosion—sending him on the run from rival gangsters and the CIA, according to its logline. Dragged into the fray is Jagger Rose, a normally cool, young hit-woman who was tasked with supervising Valentine, and has wound up with a target on her back too. Just when Valentine thinks his initiation into organized crime couldn’t be more of a disaster, he learns that his mother is conspiring with the FBI, and has promised them–since his birth–that he’ll be an informant. That was definitely not his plan. But for now, he and Jagger need to find a way to come together and fight for control of their territory, and their fate. Bendis and series co-creator Michael Oeming “(Powers”) executive produce. Tze Chun (“I’m a Virgo”) is set as showrunner. Per Amazon, “Pearl” is about Pearl Tanaka, an outsider among outsiders — a Japanese American with albinism, born into a world ruled by the American yakuza. Now she uses her unequaled skills as a tattoo artist to make an honest living in San Francisco. That all changes the day that she meets another tattoo artist, Rick Araki, and saves his life. Rick has made enemies of a different yakuza clan, and by interfering with their hit on him, Pearl might just have ignited a deadly gang war. And worse, Pearl has inadvertently revealed to her yakuza bosses one of her deepest secrets: she has a real talent for killing. Now, to pay off her debt, she must become their assassin. Bendis executive produces alongside series co-creator Michael Gaydos (“Jessica Jones”) and showrunner Chris Collins (“The Man in the High Castle”). Best known for co-creating the Marvel and DC comic-book characters Miles Morales, Jessica Jones, Riri Williams, Maria Hill, Naomi and more, Bendis founded the imprint Jinxworld, which is made up of creator-owned comics housed at Dark Horse Comics. These titles include “Masterpiece” with co-creator Alex Maleev, sci-fi epic “Joy Operations” with co-creator Stephen Byrne, action comedy “The Ones” with co-creator Jacob Edgar, the Yakuza romance “Pearl” with co-creator Michael Gaydos, spy thriller “Cover” with co-creator David Mack, and the alternate history mob story “Murder Inc.” with co-creator Mike Avon Oeming. “Brian has had immense success throughout his career, with a hand in some of the most culturally impactful comics in recent memory,” said Nick Pepper, head of U.S. SVOD wholly owned development at Amazon MGM Studios. “We are thrilled that he is bringing his captivating storytelling to Amazon MGM Studios.” Bendis added: “I am thrilled to be part of Amazon’s stellar lineup of storytellers.

Minyoung Kim, VP of APAC Content (ex-India), provided an update on the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity. In 2021, the streamer committed $100M to the fund across five years to enhance pathways for underrepresented communities in entertainment. Kim said that the streamer has so far spent around $41M on 200 programs, with over 13,000 participants in more than 50 countries around the world. Netflix added that over 450 people from these programs have gone on to work on the platform’s productions in a variety of roles, ranging from line producers and associate editors to casting assistants and grips. The fund has partnered with local film festivals like the Jogja-NETPAC Asian Film Festival this year to run programs, and content agencies like Taiwan’s TAICCA to run a six-week screenwriting workshop with local writers. Watch on Deadline She also highlighted that Netflix works with production studios to identify skill gaps in local industries and organize production workshops to fill these gaps. For example, the Korea team identified VFX and virtual production as two key areas for development in the domestic industry. They have since launched the “Grow Creative in Korea” program, training over 2,400 students as part of the streamer’s commitment to developing production talent, transferring knowledge and technical skills in virtual production, color and dubbing. Earlier this week on the sidelines of BIFF, Netflix launched its 2025 Korean film slate, which included Revelations, from Train to Busan director Yeon Sang-ho, as well as sci-fi disaster film The Great Flood starring Kim Da-mi (Itaewon Class) and Park Hae-soo (Squid Game), among others. At the Creative Asia Forum, Born For the Spotlight writer-director (and former actress) Yen Yi-wen was also present to talk about the Mandarin-language series. “I was an actress for 20 years and during that time, I really wanted to get an award. I got one in 2015, but the day after the award ceremony, I had to return to a production set,” Yen said. “But I realised my mindset had changed and I could not continue something like this. I was playing a mediocre character in a mediocre title with a mediocre script. I suddenly felt like I wasn’t deserving of the award. So that day, I went home and started to write a script about an actress who loses her ability to act after winning an award.” That story became Born For the Spotlight, which premieres on the platform on November 7. Yen also talked about the changes that she has seen in the Taiwanese entertainment industry over the past few years. “In the past, actresses didn’t have many options for roles and about four to five years ago, when I was around 40, I was thinking about whether there was an age limit for certain roles,” Yen added. “I decided to write my own story about a middle-aged woman, so that I can tell stories that I want to see.” Olive Ting, Born For the Spotlight’s producer, echoed that audiences are now more exposed to different genres and formats of shows, and the industry’s stories have become more ambitious about breaking away from traditional formulas. “In Taiwan, about 20 years ago, we had mostly romantic stories and there was always a cliche about female leads waiting for love from rich handsome guys,” Ting said. “Artistic shifts have coincided with social changes in Taiwan. We are excited that there are so many options now and we don’t have to follow traditional storylines. We are grateful that viewers in Taiwan are open to different stories and genres, which allows us to explore more ambitious projects.” On the Japanese panel, Beyond Goodbye director Hiroshi Kurosaki talked about how his background in documentaries shaped his approach towards directing a fictional love story. Beyond Goodbye tells the story of Saeko, who loses the love of her life, Yusuke, in an accident on the day he proposes to her. Another man, Naruse, receives Yusuke’s heart in a transplant, giving him a new lease on life. “We wanted to make a fantastical love story,” Kurosaki said. “But I told everyone that we need to make the show 5 centimeters above reality, not 10 centimeters, to make this a beautiful but believable love story.” As part of his research for the show, he talked to a surgeon that does heart transplants and asked about the concept of “memory transfer” that became a key part of the series. On the Indonesia panel, Cigarette Girl co-directors Kamila Andini and Ifa Isfansyah talked about the 12-year journey to adapt the book of the same name by Ratih Kumala, into a series. The series jumps between two periods — the 1960s and early 2000s — to tell the story of a family business involved in Indonesia’s clove cigarette industry. “The story is all about female strength for me, especially during the period in the show where women didn’t have as many opportunities,” Andini said. “This is a time to acknowledge female strength and we wanted to make space for that.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strategy & Miscellaneous News -> General News & Strategy -> Misc.

The studio has signed first-look deals with nine writers and comics — Scott Aukerman, Karen Chee, Shaun Diston, Chris Garcia, Chris Gethard, Lisa Gilroy, Lacey Jeka, Julie Klausner and Alok Vaid-Menon. They’ll all work on developing new comedy series projects and potentially collaborate with other writers and producers who have deals at Sony. Lauren Stein, head of creative at Sony Pictures TV, and Colin Davis, executive vp comedy development, said the deals are part of an effort at the studio to bring in what Davis calls a “spectrum of sensibilities” to comedy development. Related Stories “The list is a collective of a different creators and multihyphenates that we believe each have unique voices and a hit show in them,” Davis said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “They really represent the comedy community at large, and we’re excited that we get to be the third-party studio that gets to sell what their visions are to a variety of places.” Stein told THR that the deals are also a signal to “come play” at the studio: “It’s our way of saying, ‘Come here.’ You’re not tied down here because it’s just a first look. You still have the flexibility to work at other places, staff on other shows. But bring us those passion projects. Bring us the idea that you don’t think you could get another studio to do. Because of our independence, we have the most flexibility, and you’ll get the most freedom for your creativity.” The nine people in this wave of deals are a mix of more established writers and performers like Gethard (The Chris Gethard Show), Aukerman (Comedy Bang! Bang!) and Klausner (Difficult People, Schmigadoon!), and up-and-comers like Vaid-Menon (Netflix’s Gender Agenda comedy special) and actor-writers Gilroy and Jeka (who, incidentally, have worked with Aukerman and Gethard, respectively, in the past). Chee is a three-time Emmy nominee as part of the Late Night With Seth Meyers writing staff; Diston has penned episodes of Peacock’s Twisted Metal and Hulu’s Woke; and Garcia is a writer and co-producer on Sony and Fox’s new animated series Universal Basic Guys. After signing the first-looks, the writers were encouraged to meet and talk with other writers and producers who are based at Sony. “For us, it’s important for the creative process for people to meet and talk — you don’t know where an idea is going to come from,” said Stein. “A producer may have an idea that a writer has a very specific connection to — you only learn those things by having people meet.” Davis also noted that Gethard has already started working with Jessi Klein (Dead to Me, Big Mouth), who has an existing deal at Sony, on an idea. Like most other studios, Sony has in recent years pushed to mine its IP library for reboots and updates on titles like CBS’ SWAT and Netflix/Pop TV’s One Day at a Time. The incoming writers — all of whom have pretty specific sensibilities — will be free to come up with new takes on Sony-owned properties, but they’ll also be encouraged to develop original ideas. “It’s not a move away from [IP],” Stein said of the new deals. “I think it’s just a broadening out. There’s no mandate, so if you have an original idea, great. If you have an idea that is based on existing IP that we have, that’s OK too. We don’t tell people that you have to be original or you have to base it on something.” THR Newsletters Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Deals -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who started talking about more deals shortly after inking a massive merger, irritating Wall Street, has been publicly quiet on that front for a bit. Today said he sees opportunities in M&A with the company on a stronger financial footing and rolling streamer Max out globally to achieve necessary scale. Discovery’s acquisition of Warner Media generated significant debt which stood at about $50 billion at one point. WBD has paid about $15 billion of that down, Zaslav said during a Q&A at Bernstein’s Strategic Decisions investor conference today. Free cash flow is stronger, streaming is (on-and-off) profitable “and we have a long-term plan.” “Over the next two to three years, I expect that there’s going to be some opportunities. There will be some players that want to get out of the business. There will be others that will look to consolidate ... And so I think we will look to be opportunistic during that time.” It’s one reason WBD has been trying hard to clean up its finances, he said. At the current moment, the company may be unwilling to fork out what it needs to keep the NBA, putting its future with the league in doubt. Watch on Deadline He expects a shakeout to four or five global streaming players, as do others. “I think that the global nature of this business is going to require a number of players to decide whether they want to go it alone ... or be part of a bigger global organization. I do think that some companies will be for sale.” Zaslav didn’t mention Paramount Global, the company very much for sale right now. He met with Par’s controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and former CEO Bob Bakish last fall when deal talk there began to heat up, but nothing came of it. Investors then were dubious at a another big transaction (and still may be). He indicated at a conference earlier this month that he’d backed off, saying, “However it turns out, I hope that they’re successful.” Asked in a kind of lightening round to respond to the word ‘Paramount’ he said “great storytelling heritage.” As for ‘M&A’ – “A lot of opportunity lies ahead. But be careful. Make sure you’re buying smart.” One big deal impediment for WBD is its tanked stock as the market sees less strategic opportunity than he does right now. The share, trending lower today, are at about $7.65. “The marketplace is not giving great value to the content side of the business. Right now, if you look at the overall multiple, the marketplace is giving so much better multiples and much bigger value to the distribution side,” he acknowledged. He said being able to to drive WBD content on Max globally “is going to will, I think create a lot of shareholder value.” “In the end, the consumer finds the product they like the best, whether it’s the best cookie, whether it’s the best sandwich, whether it’s the best storytelling.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Investor Relations -> General News & Strategy -> IR Conferences"}]}

Vinciquerra will remain with SPE as non-executive chairman through December 2025. “He’s got the experience that we need in the person that is going to run the company. And he’s very calm, very level-headed, very smart,” Vinciquerra says of Ahuja’s promotion. Under Vinciquerra’s leadership, SPE was deliberate in its positioning at a moment of massive transition for the pay TV sector. Sony did not join its larger rival studios in rushing to build direct-to-consumer streaming platforms. The one money-losing streamer that SPE had under its roof when Vinciquerra arrived in mid-2017 — Crackle — was sold off less than two years later. “Early on, we decided not to go into the general entertainment streaming business. All of these companies had jumped in feet first and really didn’t have a plan, except that they were going to be desperate for subscribers. And instead of us diving in to do the same thing, we made the decision to be the arms dealer, and we bulked up on our bench of [TV] creators and did very, very well with it,” Vinciquerra tells Variety. Instead, SPE embraced Sony Corp’s strength with anime production through its Japan-based Aniplex banner to assemble a subscription anime streamer that taps into the rabid fandom for the serial animation format. Today, SPE’s Crunchyroll streamer boasts more than 15 million subscribers, and it delivers a profit. “We could see that [anime fans] were growing and it was relatively inexpensive product. We weren’t spending $5 million an episode. We’re spending $200,000 to $400,000 an episode. So we jumped in with both feet, and now we’re in a good place with Crunchyroll,” Vinciquerra says. “We’re still searching for the next very specific, genre-based streaming service. We think there’s more to do there.” Vinciquerra’s reinvention campaign also included getting a grip on SPE’s more than 20 in-house production banners, which were spread far and wide in Europe, Latin America and Asia to a degree that didn’t make financial sense for the studio. “We decided to focus on the places where we thought we could really win,” Vinciquerra says. Chief among them is the U.K., where international TV production chief Wayne Garvie has steered SPE to scoop up prosperous production outfits, including Jane Tranter’s Bad Wolf (“His Dark Materials”), Eleven (“Sex Education”) and Eleventh Hour Films (“Alex Riter”). Vinciquerra’s first 18 months at the studio was marked by a whirlwind of restructurings, layoffs and management changes. He also sold or shuttered dozens of international cable channels that were a drag on earnings. He had strong convictions about what needed to be done, drawing from his experience that includes 10 years of running Fox Networks Group and six years as a media advisor to private equity giant TPG. “I was on the board of Pandora, I was on the board of DirecTV, I was on the board of Qualcomm and a bunch of other companies. So I saw very clearly what was happening in our business from the outside,” Vinciquerra recalls. “When I got here, the company was in rough shape.” He had strong feelings about what needed to change but he did second-guess himself occasionally during the go-go years leading up to the shock of the pandemic. “I questioned myself — am I right not getting in the streaming service business? Because everybody told me how stupid I was for not doing it and getting rid of the cable networks. People here questioned that a lot,” he recalls. Vinciquerra stuck with his instincts to streamline SPE operations. The need to rehabilitate struggling assets has been a constant in his career, ever since he got his first job in radio sales in Albany, N.Y. Years later, he learned an important lesson when he he took over as general manager of Westinghouse Broadcasting’s WBZ-TV Boston. It was just about the time the parent company slashed costs and took the station’s head count to 200 employees, down from 350. “You have to have a critical mass of employees to understand what the problem is, how to solve the problem and what to do to get to the place you want it to be,” he says. “Once you get a critical mass of people believing in it, the naysayersgo underground.” Vinciquerra stayed in broadcasting, working as a senior leader for CBS Television Stations and for Hearst in the 1990s when that company went on a station-buying spree. He credits Peter Chernin, the respected media investor and former head of 20th Century Fox and president of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., for bringing him into the showbiz big leagues. Chernin pushed Vinciquerra to segue into overseeing the Fox broadcast network as well as its cable properties. It was a goal that really paid off — especially as Vinciquerra remembers trying to talk Chernin out of giving him the job at first. Years later, he’s grateful that Chernin didn’t listen to him. “Logically, it didn’t make any sense to hire me to run the Fox broadcast network because I’d never had any network experience,” Vinciquerra recalls. I ran TV stations. It’s a very different business.” Among his accomplishments at Sony, Vinciquerra cites overcoming two very different challenges. When he took the role in 2017, Vinciquerra told the corporate leaders that the studio was missing opportunities by not working more closely with talent and content franchises owned by Sony Corp.’s PlayStation gaming division and in the Sony Music division. The Sony leadership in Tokyo was supportive. But from his experience at Fox, he also knew such collaborations could not be dictated from above. “It doesn’t work if you say, ‘You do this.’ You have to get the [creative] groups to work together and get their creative juices flowing,” he says. Sony convened about 40 key creative executives from gaming and pictures, put them in a large conference room and supplied them with a whiteboard. The directive to both teams from Tokyo was to find ways to work together “without worry too much about who’s going to pay for what,” Vinciquerra recalls. “They spent two days together and they came up with 12 or 14 different projects to work on together. We’ve done seven or eight now,” he says. The list includes HBO’s acclaimed drama series adaptation “The Last of Us,” which is heading to its strike-delayed sophomore season, 2022’s “Uncharted” and 2023’s “Gran Turismo” and “Twisted Metal.” On the music side, Bruce Springsteen is working on an unscripted project with Sony’s TV division. Bad Bunny, the top-selling reggaeton star, had a small role in 2022’s Brad Pitt starrer “Bullet Train,” and he will again appear in an upcoming Sony film. Another notable milestone during his tenure was the extensive renovation and refurbishment of SPE’s massive lot in Culver City, which was once the hallowed ground of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Some of the studio’s soundstages hadn’t been maintained well for decades. Wood planks between the walls were buckling, creating a fire hazard among other problems, not to mention the other aging infrastructure inside. A strong earthquake might have easily knocked one or more down. Early on in his run, Vinciquerra’s team hammered out a five-year plan for making infrastructure upgrades and improvements. And then COVID happened. With the lot empty of staff and production activity for months, most of the heavy-duty construction work was completed in 18 months. “We ended up redoing virtually every wall and every stage through the rest of the pandemic,” he says. “Even now, we’re not quite done.” The Culver City lot is such a …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strategy & Miscellaneous News -> General News & Strategy -> Strategy"}]}

Disney will continue to manage its own digital media, like premium video-on-demand. It’s unclear if this will result in layoffs at Disney. However, the studio is expected to conduct an internal assessment across all business functions that support physical entertainment amid the transition to Sony, according to sources familiar with the agreement. Popular on Variety According to Disney, the licensing model allows the studio to continue to offer films and TV shows through physical retailers and to respond to consumer demand more efficiently. The company said the shift is consistent with strategies it’s implemented companywide, as well as transitions in other markets. Whatever the reasoning, physical disc sales have long been in decline — and they show no signs of rebounding amid the industry’s streaming boom. Revenue for physical media in the U.S. dropped 28%, to $754 million, in the first half of 2023, compared with $1.05 billion in the prior year, according to data from trade association DEG: The Digital Entertainment Group. It’s projected that 2024 will be the first year revenue drops below one billion dollars. As a result, Best Buy discontinued sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs in the store and online in early 2024.

But AI needs to pass a very important test: Can it help make better shows and better films? That is the test and that’s what we’ve got to figure out.” Netflix benefits “greatly from improving the quality of the movies and the shows, much more so than we do by making them a little cheaper,” Sarandos added. “So, any tool that can go toward enhancing the quality, making them better, is something that’s going to help the industry a great deal.” Watch on Deadline Prior to the call, the company reported strong numbers across the board, including a quarter-to-quarter increase of 5.1 million subscribers, beating Wall Street forecasts.

Discovery is likely to expire Monday without a new deal, according to people familiar with the matter. Beginning next week, the NBA will be able to work on agreements for new partners to show packages of games. Amazon, Apple, YouTube TV, Comcast's NBCUniversal/Peacock and Netflix have all had preliminary conversations with the league expressing potential interest, CNBC reported last year. The exclusive negotiating window with the league's incumbent partners officially ends Monday. While no agreement is expected to be announced by the deadline, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery both continue to work on terms with the league, an NBA spokesperson confirmed. The NBA would like to bring in at least one new partner to serve as a flagship streamer, CNBC reported last year. The league wants a \"robust\" streaming partner that will use marketing and reach to make the games a priority on their platform, CNBC reported. \"We continue to have productive discussions with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery on a renewal of our media deals,\" a league spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. Spokespeople for Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment. Warner Bros. Discovery's TBS began airing NBA games in 1984, and TNT has shown NBA games since 1988. Disney's ESPN and ABC have broadcast the NBA since 2002. The two companies have both publicly expressed a desire to renew with the NBA and have joined forces with Fox to launch a new streaming service geared to sports fans that don't already pay for cable. That service will debut in the fall, the companies said earlier this year. A more complex deal The NBA is looking to double the $24 billion it generated from its previous media rights deal with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery by adding new partners and charging more for rights, CNBC reported last year. In 2014, during the NBA's last negotiation, the league renewed its rights with Disney and Time Warner about five months before the end of its exclusive negotiating window. The NBA also doubled the price for its rights in that deal from its previous agreement. This time, the discussions with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are more complicated because of the likely addition of a third party. Both Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery aren't eager to lose the rights they already have. Still, the league is looking for a large increase in fees, and neither company wants to carry the full burden of paying significantly more for what they already have, according to people familiar with the negotiations. That allows for the league to bring in another party — or possibly even two more. The NBA could sell its new in-season tournament package of games to a separate media company other than its primary new streaming partner, one of the people said. The value of popular live sports programming has increased because of its value to advertisers. While ad-free subscription streaming services have increasingly become the home for popular scripted programming, sports are still predominantly watched live, forcing viewers to see commercials. Last year's NBA playoffs was the most watched in 11 years across TNT, ABC, ESPN and NBA TV, according to Nielsen. The 2023-24 NBA regular season averaged 1.09 million viewers, up 1% from last year and the highest across-network average in four years, according to SportsMediaWatch. Still, regular-season viewership plateaued this year among standard cable and broadcast networks. Across ABC, ESPN and TNT, the average televised audience of 1.56 million was down 1% from last year's 1.59 million and was the lowest in three years. TNT averaged 1.4 million viewers for its 65 regular-season games, equaling the year prior, according to a Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson. The first round of the NBA playoffs will start Saturday.

The entertainment giant reported revenues of $22.57 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 30, up 6 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Income was $948 million, down 6 percent from a year ago, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.25, compared to $0.14 a year ago. Related Stories The growth was driven by entertainment, where revenues were up by 14 percent to $10.8 billion, with segment operating income surging by more than 100 percent to $1.07 billion. The company had both Deadpool & Wolverine and Inside Out 2 in the quarter, a pair of massive theatrical hits. And streaming improved its profitability, with operating income of $321 million between the company’s direct-to-consumer offerings. Disney+, meanwhile, added more than four million “core” subscribers, and now has more than 120 million core subs. Revenue in DTC was $5.8 billion. The company adds that it expects to see a modest drop in subscribers in Q1. Still, both Disney’s sports division — led by ESPN — and its experiences division had a bit of softness, and led to the lower income results compared to last year. Sports revenue was essentially flat at $3.9 billion, but operating income fell 5 percent to $929 million. At Disney’s experiences division, revenues rose by 1 percent in the quarter, driven by domestic parks, while operating income fell by 6 percent to $1.7 billion. The revenue and income were impacted largely by Disney’s international parks, which were impacted by the Olympics in Paris, which typically causes a drop in attendance, as well as some softness in Shanghai, according to executives. However, after consumer softness in domestic parks last quarter, executives said they felt the domestic side is “strengthening” and is positioned to do so moving forward. And in an unusual move, Disney actually provided some guidance for Wall Street stretching all the way to fiscal 2027 (a sign, perhaps, of the influence of its relatively new CFO Hugh Johnston). For fiscal 2025, which starts this quarter, the company is projecting high single digit EPS growth, an $875 million increase in streaming operating income, double digit operating income growth in sports, and 6-8 percent operating income growth in experiences, weighted to the second half of the year. The company also says the experiences division will face a $130 million impact from Hurricanes Milton and Helene. For fiscal 2026, the company is expecting double digit EPS growth, and operating income growth in the single digits for sports and experiences, and low double digits for entertainment. And in fiscal 2027, Disney is projecting double digit EPS growth. “This was a pivotal and successful year for The Walt Disney Company, and thanks to the significant progress we’ve made, we have emerged from a period of considerable challenges and disruption well positioned for growth and optimistic about our future,” said Disney CEO Bob Iger in a statement. “Our solid performance in the fiscal fourth quarter reflected the success of our strategic efforts to improve quality, innovation, efficiency, and value creation. In Q4 we saw one of the best quarters in the history of our film studio, improved profitability in our streaming businesses, a record-breaking 60 Emmy Awards for the company, the continued power of live sports, and the unveiling of an impressive collection of new projects coming to our Experiences segment. Iger added, “As a result of our strategies and our focus on managing our businesses for both the near- and long-term, we are differentiating ourselves from traditional competitors, leveraging the deepest and broadest set of entertainment assets in the industry to drive attractive returns and further advance our goals.” THR Newsletters Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Investor Relations -> General News & Strategy -> Quarterly Earnings"}]}

The Trolls franchise’s Gina Shay is returning to produce alongside Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri (The Super Mario Bros. Movie), with Brad Ableson (Minions: The Rise of Gru) co-directing. Murphy hinted that the project was in motion in a video interview with Collider just last month. “We started doing Shrek four or five months ago,” he said. “I recorded the first act, and we’ll be doing it this year. We’ll finish it up.” In that interview, Murphy let slip that his character Donkey, the trusty sidekick of Myers’ ogre Shrek, also will be getting his own spinoff movie.

The franchise kicked off with the 2001 film that introduced viewers to Shrek, an ogre embarking on a quest to rescue Princess Fiona (Diaz). Winning the first Oscar for Best Animated Feature and grossing more than $488 million worldwide, the original film’s success paved the way to sequels Shrek 2 (2004), where Shrek meets Fiona’s parents, and Shrek the Third (2007), which follows Shrek’s journey to find the next heir to the throne. The fourth installment, Shrek Forever After (2010), explores Shrek’s midlife crisis and his wish to erase his past. The franchise also includes the spi-off Puss in Boots (2011), starring Antonio Banderas as the swashbuckling feline, and its sequel Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, which was Oscar-nominated and grossed $481M globally upon its December 2022 debut.

Discovery CEO David Zaslav says execs “continue to talk to the NBA” about a renewal of rights, but he argued that even without pro hoops the company’s sports offerings are “very robust.” “I was just down in Atlanta. We’ve got a great team down there and we love our experience with the NBA,” the exec said in an appearance Thursday at Bernstein’s Strategic Decisions Conference. “But in general, we’re a leader in sports around the world. We have the Olympics in Europe ... a full buffet of content around the world. We have football in a number of markets in Europe and Latin America. This is what we do for a living. We’re in the business of sport and in sport, deals come up and you look at those deals and you make a decision about the overall quality of the full menu of content you have for each of your platforms.” A number of recent press reports have indicated that WBD could be on the outside looking in with the NBA after four decades of being a home for the sport and its best-known studio show, Inside the NBA. The current rights deals expire at the end of the 2024-25 season and WBD did not reach an agreement during the exclusive negotiating window with the league. Watch on Deadline NBCUniversal is said to have returned to the arena after two decades away and Disney-ESPN has reached terms on a renewal. As with the NFL, which carved out a set of streaming exclusives for Prime Video, the NBA is understood to have done the same with the Amazon division. No formal announcements have been made, and there are conflicting reports about WBD’s rights to match the bids of others given the company’s status as an incumbent rights holder. The company has been “on a journey here in the U.S.” in terms of sports, Zaslav said, noting the addition of NHL, NASCAR and college football rights in recent years. “When you put that together with March Madness and baseball playoffs and the U.S. soccer that we have, it’s a very robust offering for consumers that they can watch on TNT in the U.S. all year round,” he said. “That is our job, to continue to look at, how do we continue to nourish an audience that loves sports on TNT? ... That’s what we’ve been doing. We’ve been very strategic about adding sport to TNT over the last several years and we feel very good about where we are.” Funding sports rights (in the case of the NBA, a proposition worth tens of billions of dollars) is difficult for WBD given its substantial debt load left over from the 2022 closing of the WarnerMedia-Discovery merger. The company’s stock has sunk below $8 a share, less than a third of its value at the time of the merger, as investors weigh the company’s prospects. As rights elapse and new ones become available, Zaslav continued, execs try to be “strategic about what content we have on TNT in the UK, what content we have in Europe, what content we have in America and make sure that we have what we think is enough content to create real shareholder value.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Sports -> General News & Strategy"}]}

The lacking performance is reflective of larger industry trends, but the years of increasingly testing park guests’ tolerance for high ticket prices and additional fees might finally be catching up to the House of Mouse. While Disney had a net positive Q3, its Experiences sector brought in just $8.4 billion in revenue, making for a paltry 2% growth compared with this time last year. Operating profit, meanwhile, slipped 3%, to $2.2 billion. The company chalked up the results to “moderation of consumer demand ... that exceeded our previous expectations” and noted the downturn will likely impact its domestic parks for “the next few quarters.” Despite Disney’s ever-growing portfolio, parks are still a vital part of its bottom line. Disney Experiences, which includes Disney parks and cruise ships, made up 70% of the company’s total operating income in 2023 alone, per Fast Company. So far this fiscal year, Experiences has accounted for about 40% of Disney’s total revenue. Disney Experiences’ sluggish quarter is partly reflective of a larger slowdown happening in the theme parks industry. Comcast, owner of Universal Destinations & Experiences, reported a 10.6% decrease in parks revenue for Q2, while Six Flags saw total revenue (-1%), attendance (-2%) and in-park spending (-5%) all slide backward. Despite the cooldown, Disney still dominates the competition in terms of attendance. The Themed Entertainment Association (TEA) and AECOM Economics & Advisory’s recently published “2023 Theme Index Report” noted that Disney claimed 8 of the top 10 most visited parks globally, with Florida’s Magic Kingdom (17.7 million) and Anaheim’s Disneyland (17.3 million), respectively, taking first and second place. Both of those parks, however, saw only a few percentage points of growth compared with 2022, and neither has consistently achieved pre-pandemic attendance numbers. Looking at Disney’s domestic parks attendance over the past several years, in fact, reveals a relatively mixed bag. Turnout for Disney’s Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom is trending downward, and while EPCOT and California Adventure had healthy YoY growth, only the latter out of all six parks has surpassed pre-pandemic attendance levels (Disney complied with government mandated attendance caps for the first several months after reopening in 2021). In general, the modest growth rates for U.S. theme parks last year — Disney and otherwise — are especially apparent when looking at attendance overseas, which saw an increase of double and even triple-digit percentages in 2023. Venues in China and Japan are still enjoying a wave fueled by COVID restrictions being lifted, and yet the “pandemic bump” didn’t seem to do nearly as much for U.S.-based parks. A possible explanation behind Disney’s parks slowdown is a similar phenomenon playing out in the live music industry: High prices are starting to outpace demand and consumers’ willingness to pay up. Disney vacation planning site AllEars, which keeps records of Disney World ticket prices, found that a single-day adult ticket was between $90 and $99 in 2014. Starting next year, the same ticket will cost between $119 and $189 — a 32.22% and 90.91% increase, respectively. Going back another decade shows ticket prices have more than doubled since 2005 ($59.75 flat) and increased almost every year between then and now. In response to the rising ticket prices, a Disney spokesperson said that the parks offer more price choices and value deals for guests than ever before, including local resident discounts and annual passes. Of course, Disney World attendance still consistently rose in previous years despite rising prices. The turning point seems to have been when Disney started adding more fees alongside the exorbitant ticket prices. The company scrapped its free FastPass system for the paid Genie+ (now Lighting Lane) service in 2021, which was so disliked it made line wait times worse. At Disney World, the free airport shuttle for resort guests is now a paid add-on, while the “Minnie Van” shuttle that transported guests between parks now uses surge pricing — true to its sponsor, Lyft. A Disney spokesperson added that additional fees of this nature are now standard across the theme park industry and are competitive compared to what other parks charge for similar services like express lines. Several services have also been reintroduced due to guest demand in recent years, including free parking for resort guests and dining plans. The hefty ticket prices plus the costs for formerly free services have resulted in budget akin to traveling abroad — which seems to be what those who can afford a trip to Disneyland or Disney World are choosing to do instead. Why go to the Japan area of EPCOT when you can go to Tokyo Disneyland on roughly the same budget? Disney received a costly reminder of this reality with the closure of Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, the hotel where guests could LARP through an original Star Wars story and stay in windowless rooms starting at $2,500 a night. For now, Disney’s strategy is to continue throwing money at the problem. New attractions historically equal bigger crowds — it seemingly worked for EPCOT and California Adventure last year — and a slew of major additions to the parks were announced at the recent D23 conference as part of its ongoing $60 billion investment. The company is apparently banking on these bigger and bolder attractions, featuring its treasure trove of beloved IPs, revitalizing park demand and justifying the ticket prices. Considering that some Disney disciples will happily take on debt to visit the parks, that bet doesn’t seem totally farfetched. But that’s also assuming Disney won’t do what it has done almost every year and raise prices once again."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strategy & Miscellaneous News -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Jeffrey Piccolo is suing the company for $50,000 because his wife Dr. Kanokporn Tangsuan suffered an allergic reaction after consuming food at the privately run Raglan Road Irish Pub in October and later died at a local hospital. Disney’s attorneys had requested that the case be dismissed and settled out of court. Raglan Road is a restaurant tenant at Disney Springs not owned or operated by Disney. Watch on Deadline Walt Disney Parks and Resorts had argued that by signing up for a free 30-day trial of Disney+ in 2019, and again when purchasing the theme park tickets in 2023 through his Disney+ account, Piccolo agreed to the streamer’s terms of service, which includes that “all disputes” with “The Walt Disney Company or its affiliates” be settled out of court via arbitration. Now the company has waived that arbitration and will “have the matter proceed in court.” Disney said it is in the process of submitting the waiver-withdrawal filing in court. “At Disney, we strive to put humanity above all other considerations,” Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D’Amaro said in a statement. “With such unique circumstances as the ones in this case, we believe this situation warrants a sensitive approach to expedite a resolution for the family who have experienced such a painful loss. As such, we’ve decided to waive our right to arbitration and have the matter proceed in court.” Piccolo’s lawyers have said that Disney’s terms-of-service argument “bordered on the surreal” and “is so outrageously unreasonable and unfair as to shock the judicial conscience.” “In effect, his attorneys said, “Walt Disney Parks and Resorts is explicitly seeking to bar its 150 million Disney+ subscribers from ever prosecuting a wrongful death case against it in front of a jury even if the case facts have nothing to with Disney+.” The complaint states that the family told their server repeatedly about Tangsuan’s food allergies but were assured that it would be OK."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strategy & Miscellaneous News -> General News & Strategy"}]}

As part of the pact, the streamer and studio will finance and release movies from Stuber’s new production company under United Artists, a languishing label that once operated under the auspice of MGM. In its heyday, United Artists released movies like “The Pink Panther,” “Rocky” “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” “Network” and the James Bond films. The agreement calls for Stuber and his soon-to-be launched company to produce several films annually. They will be released both theatrically and via Prime Video, Amazon’s streaming service. Stuber’s new company will be based on Amazon MGM Studios’ Culver City lot. The pact is a first-look one, giving Amazon MGM Studios the initial crack at the projects Stuber develops. In addition, Stuber will be involved in all projects released by the new UA. Popular on Variety “With his proven track record of delivering global hits and an eye towards theatrical fare, Scott’s expertise and vision align perfectly with our film strategy,” said Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios. “We are so proud to welcome him to our lot and partner with him on the relaunch of the legendary UA brand, as we work to leverage existing and new IP into big, broad films that resonate with worldwide audiences.” “I’ve had the pleasure of working with Mike Hopkins, Jen Salke and Courtenay Valenti over the years, and I’m thrilled to partner with them to produce a slate of films and to relaunch the iconic UA brand that has such a rich history of cinematic storytelling,” said Stuber. “During this dynamic and transformative time for our industry, I am excited to have the opportunity to work with partners who are committed to telling stories that reach and resonate with global audiences. I look forward to producing a wide range of films with great filmmakers, using both original story concepts and MGM and United Artists’ incredible library of existing IP.” At Netflix, Stuber helped bolster the company’s original film productions, enlisting top directors like Martin Scorsese (“The Irishman”), Jane Campion (“The Power of the Dog”), Alfonso Cuarón (“Roma”) and Bradley Cooper (“Maestro”) to make movies for the streaming service. Though Stuber established Netflix as a destination for top talent to bring projects, he often struggled to produce movies that gripped the popular consciousness. And that was despite the fact that Netflix spent generously on the movies it made. Stuber left Netflix in January with Dan Lin, the producer of “The Lego Movie” and “Sherlock Holmes,” replacing him as the head of film as the streamer changed course in an attempt to rein in costs and concentrate on more populist fare. Prior to Netflix, Stuber founded and led Bluegrass Films, which produced such films as “Ted,” “Central Intelligence” and “Safe House.” He was also the former vice chairman of worldwide production at Universal Studios, overseeing the likes of “A Beautiful Mind,” “Meet the Parents” and both the Bourne and Fast and the Furious franchises. As for United Artists, the studio originally faltered with the box office debacle of 1980’s “Heaven’s Gate,” Michael Cimino’s critically-derided Western epic. It was sold to MGM a few years later with the studio attempting to reinvigorate the brand with mixed results. Over the ensuing decades, it would produce hits and critical favorites such as “The Birdcage,” “Leaving Las Vegas” and a Pierce Brosnan-led remake of “The Thomas Crown Affair,” as well as duds like “Showgirls.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Deals -> General News & Strategy"}]}

The Paramount Office of Global Inclusion helms the program. It is an eight-month-long program that provides mentorships, career development, support and personal access to executives and the decision-making processes for new writers in television. The program’s end goal is to prepare them for a television career. For 16 weeks, participants will attend small workshop-style meetings with showrunners, executive producers, agents, managers and development and current executives to better understand how the writing and television business works. The writers are paired with an executive from the Paramount studio brands for regular meetings, fostering discussions about their work and receiving valuable creative feedback and advice to advance their professional journey.

Viewing to British shows and movies on Netflix and Prime Video in the States skyrocketed by 40% between Q2 2023 and Q1 of this year, representing an additional 400 million hours watched, according to Digital i research shared exclusively with Deadline. The Q1 2024 figure was the highest since Digital-i started counting three years ago. At the same time, viewing to all content on these platforms rose by the smaller figure of 9%. British shows to have hit the heights in the States included Fool Me Once, Bridgerton and Baby Reindeer, which made up three of the five most-watched series in the U.S. between January and May of this year. Other titles to have performed well included The Gentleman, 3 Body Problem, and Prime Video double Clarkson’s Farm and The Grand Tour. Digital-i counted any show that was either commissioned out of the UK or where “significant production was undertaken in the UK,” with the theory that the lengthy Hollywood labor strikes, which saw actors and writers down tools for months, may have pushed more content production and spend into the nation. This means shows like Netflix’s 3 Body Problem are included. Research from Ofcom earlier this week found that UK viewing to the big streamers rose by 6% in 2023. Watch on Deadline The research comes just a fortnight after Amazon bought Bray Studios, where The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power is filmed, while a recent Netflix UK slate featured splashy shows from Steven Knight, Stephen Graham and Brad Pitt’s Plan B Productions. Ampere Analysis research published several weeks back found that Netflix and Amazon had “ordered the majority of their titles from outside the U.S.” last quarter for the first time. Digital-i Chief Analytics Officer Matt Ross said the data proves that UK content has “served to reduce the impact” of the strikes, allowing SVoDs to “produce a number of global hits.” “Content strategy for major SVoD players is becoming increasingly global, and the UK has and will continue to be an important source of content that can perform well across multiple territories,” he added. When all global viewing was taken into account, Digital-i said hours of British content watched rose by a similarly high 31% during Q1, an increase of more than 1 billion hours viewed, far eclipsing the 2% rise to all content on Netflix and Prime Video. In Europe, increase for UK titles was 19%, compared with a 10% drop in viewing to all content."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> International -> General News & Strategy"}]}

CBS Studios is expanding its ever growing NCIS franchise by bringing back two fan favorite characters from the mothership series, Tony DiNozzo, played by Michael Weatherly, and Ziva David, portrayed by Cote de Pablo, who will reunite on screen for the first time in 10 years. Paramount+ has given a 10-episode series order to the untitled spinoff headlined by Weatherly and de Pablo and written by John McNamara (Trumbo, The Magicians). All three executive produce. Nicknamed NCIS: Europe, the new action-packed spinoff, set to start production later this year, will follow Tony (Weatherly) and Ziva (de Pablo) as they find themselves on the run across the continent. NCIS is one of CBS Studios’ most valuable franchises and its expansion has been a goal for the studio. This is one of two new NCIS offshoots greenlighted this year, along with the Young Gibbs prequel series for CBS, NCIS: Origins. It is also the second extension of the NCIS franchise beyond the U.S., following NCIS: Sydney, which has been airing on CBS in the U.S. Watch on Deadline RELATED: NBC Orders ‘The Hunting Party’ Crime Procedural Series After Ziva’s (de Pablo) supposed death, Tony (Weatherly) left the NCIS team to go raise their daughter. Years later, Ziva was discovered alive, leading her to complete one final mission with NCIS before she was reunited with Tony and their daughter in Paris. Since then – and where we find them in the new Paramount+ original series – Tony and Ziva have been raising their daughter, Tali, together. When Tony’s security company is attacked, they must go on the run across Europe, trying to figure out who is after them and maybe even learn to trust each other again so that they can finally have their unconventional happily ever after. “We’ve been talking about this story for many years, and now with John McNamara at the helm, we are ready,” Weatherly and de Pablo said. “The world of Tony and Ziva (and daughter Tali) promises to be an action-packed roller coaster fueled by love, danger, tears and laughter. We also want to acknowledge and thank the fans from around the world who supported the ‘Tiva’ movement for years. To this day, they say hello in grocery stores and on the street to tell us how much these characters mean to them and ask what Tony and Ziva are up to now. This is for you!” RELATED: 2024 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Weatherly hinted at a potential ‘Tiva’ reunion last month when his New Year’s tweet, “It’s time to look at time and enjoy the moment!” prompted a fan to respond, “We all would rather look at you and Ziva reuniting.” Weatherly highlighted the comment, adding, “Stay tuned... for this might be an interesting year for such ‘moments’!” He further fueled speculation this week by responding to a fan tweet lamenting about him and de Pablo, “miss the chemistry and magic you both create,” with the cryptic, “the universe works in mysterious ways...” De Pablo, Weatherly and McNamara executive produce the spinoff series with Laurie Lieser, Christina Strain and Shelley Meals. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution. “I’m incredibly excited to step into the NCIS universe with Cote and Michael and thrilled to explore it from a few new angles,” McNamara said. “Given that the franchise is such a global sensation, I think it’s phenomenal that CBS Studios and Paramount+ have given us the greenlight to shoot in Europe. As to the title of this series, if I told you what it is, I’d be violating the Espionage Act.” Weatherly, an original NCIS cast member, had been with the series since its launch in 2003. He left after 13 seasons and went on to headline another CBS/CBS Studios drama, Bull. Speculation about his potential return to the NCIS franchise picked up after Bull ended its run last spring. He recently did a surprise cameo in the Ducky tribute episode of the mothership series. RELATED: Paramount Global Says It Will Take $1B Charge Related To Layoffs And Content Strategy Shifts De Pablo joined NCIS in Season 3. She appeared in Seasons 3 through 10 and exited the series early in Season 11. In the Season 13 finale, it was revealed that Ziva apparently had died in an explosion in Israel. She returned three years later in 2019, where it was revealed she was alive and had gone into hiding. She made a surprise unannounced return in the last scene of the season 16 finale, which aired on May 21, 2019, in which Ziva arrives at Gibbs’ basement to warn him that his life is in danger. She later appeared in the first two episodes of the show’s 17th season and in that season’s 10th and 11th episodes as part of her storyline. Weatherly, repped by Anonymous Content, Verve, and McKuin Frankel Whitehead, and de Pablo, repped by UTA and Entertainment 360, have remained close off-screen. In 2018, they teamed up to executive produce detective drama MIA, which was set up at CBS. Twenty-one seasons in — currently ranking as the third-longest-running U.S. primetime drama — the mothership NCIS series remains the most watched non-sports program on broadcast. A big global seller, which once ranked as the most watched drama in the world, the venerable procedural has spawned three spinoffs in the U.S., NCIS: Los Angeles, NCIS: New Orleans as well as NCIS: Hawai’i, which kicked off its fourth season. The franchise recently went international with its first non-American offshoot, NCIS: Sydney, which also has done very well in the U.S., ranking as the most watched new series of the fall. Veteran showrunner McNamara most recently served as an executive producer on the Apple TV+ series Physical and prior to that co-created and executive produced Syfy’s The Magicians."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> TV -> Greenlights"}]}

At the center of the situation was an interview last week with author Ta-Nehisi Coates on CBS Mornings. While co-hosts Gayle King, Nate Burleson and Tony Dokoupil all sat in on the chat, Dokoupil drew criticism for dominating and pressing Coates on the section of his book, The Message, that criticizes Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. Dokoupil, who is Jewish, challenged Coates on whether he believed the state of Israel had a right to exist. CBS News brass addressed the matter during a staff call Monday featuring Adrienne Roark, the president of editorial and newsgathering, and Wendy McMahon, president of CBS News and Stations. They told employees that Dokoupil’s questioning did not meet the news division’s “editorial standards.” Watch on Deadline Paramount Chair Shari Redstone, appearing Wednesday at Advertising Week in New York, called it a “mistake” for CBS News to publicly rebuke Dokoupil. She described the interview as a “model” of “civil discourse.” George Cheeks, who oversees CBS as one of Paramount’s three Co-CEOs, issued a statement later Wednesday defending McMahon and CBS News leadership. He vowed to encourage “further substantive dialogue about perceptions of inconsistent treatment, implicit bias and the important standards our News division has in place to establish guardrails for fairness and objectivity.” Sources tell Deadline that Redstone and Cheeks speak regularly. Along with Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins, Cheeks got a major vote of confidence from Redstone just a few months ago when she installed him in the Office of the CEO when Bob Bakish was ousted. Prior to her Ad Week appearance, Redstone called Cheeks to voice her personal opinion and say that she was unhappy about how the situation had been handled. She also offered a heads-up that she was going to address the matter publicly, and he also advised her of his plan to publicly back CBS News. Redstone, who has guided Paramount as its majority shareholder and chair over the past several years, has talked frequently about the rise of anti-Semitism and her commitment to trying to use her position to combat it. The discord spilled out in the open following a period of upheaval for everyone working at CBS News and Paramount Global, which is poised to be sold to Skydance Media in a deal slated to close in the first half of 2025. The newsroom went through a round of layoffs last month that saw such personalities as Jeff Glor, co-host of CBS Mornings on the weekend, exit, part of Paramount’s trimming of 15% of its U.S. staff. During the summer, Ingrid Ciprian-Matthews announced that she was stepping down as president of CBS News, a position she held for less than a year. That was followed by a restructuring of the news leadership team, with Roark named to the new position of president of editorial and newsgathering, reporting to McMahon. Meanwhile, Norah O’Donnell, who has anchored CBS Evening News for the past five years, is stepping down after the election, with John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois co-anchoring a revamped broadcast overseen by Bill Owens, the executive producer of 60 Minutes. That change drew criticism from one of O’Donnell’s predecessors, Katie Couric, who wrote an op-ed in The New York Times criticizing the fact that the change will mean that none of the major broadcast evening news anchors will be women, although she did acknowledge that they were in leadership roles. By contrast, CBS Mornings, while still in third place among morning shows, has delivered solid enough results to be considered a bright spot. King, one of the network’s top personalities, recently signed a new deal, as did Dokoupil, who now also hosts a third hour of the show. The Coates interview also came as the news division was riding high after hosting the vice presidential debate and landing an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes. While Dokoupil’s interview became a flashpoint that led to McMahon and Roark’s comments at the editorial meeting, a source said that it was not the only time his comments have drawn concerns from other staffers. In his memo, Cheeks said that there was “strong and growing discord” that needed to be addressed at the level of an editorial meeting. During the interview itself, Dokoupil’s questioning of Coates left little room for other CBS voices the conversation, presenting harder-hitting talk than is typical of the morning show setting. In an interview for Trevor Noah’s podcast, Coates said that King, who is one of the news division’s top personalities, had shown him before the segment with his book and extensive notes on it, signaling that she would ask him a number of questions. She ended up asking him just one during the segment, which ran for almost seven minutes. Prior to the CBS episode, The Daily Show, which airs on Paramount’s Comedy Central, aired a long and congenial interview with Coates by Monday host Jon Stewart. While there is a mixture of opinion over how Dokoupil questioned Coates, there was some confusion about why the news division leadership delivered a rebuke in the all-staff meeting. Although staffers were asked to keep the conversation confidential, it quickly leaked, not entirely unsurprising given that it is the news business. During the meeting, one correspondent, Jan Crawford, said, “It sounds like we are calling out one of our anchors in a somewhat public setting on this call for failing to meet editorial standards for, I’m not even sure what.” The call, published on the site Free Press, helped magnify the story, making it bigger than typical disagreements do over network coverage. While CBS News is in the spotlight now, other networks have also seen their internal discord over coverage of culturally divisive issues and figures spill out into the open — albeit the Israel-Gaza conflict has raised deeply emotional opinions on representation and context. Inside and outside the network, there are sharply different views of the interview and how the aftermath was handled. NBC News’ hiring of Ronna McDaniel, the former chair of the Republican National Committee, drew an internal revolt that saw MSNBC anchors publicly blast the network decision. Cesar Conde, chairman of the NBCUniversal News Group, reversed the decision to put McDaniel on the payroll. Last year, CNN staffers raised their objections to the network’s decision to host a town hall with Donald Trump, with Christiane Amanpour going public with her disagreements over the event. Meanwhile, news division heads have to grapple with realities of media: Making more with less, given the decline in the linear TV business."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> News -> General News & Strategy"}]}

The deals with London-based distributor Abacus Media Rights also include acquisitions of two completed series. On the pre-buy front, the Amazon streamer has taken Woodcut Media double Murder in a Tea Cup and Murder at First Swipe, Peninsula Television’s Scissor Sisters, Big Little Fish’s Breaking Dad: The Richard Lubbock Story (working title) and Future Studios’ Lucie Blackman: Missing in Tokyo. The acquisitions are Peninsula three-part shows The Heiress and the Heist and Confession of a Crime Boss. Watch on Deadline Prime Video has tapped Amcomri Entertainment-owned Abacus for true crime docs several times over recent years, including for originals on Ian Brady, the murder of Meredith Kercher and Patrick Mackay. From the new programs, Murder in a Tea Cup looks into one of the most intriguing and bizarre British cases of the 20th Century – the serial murders of poisoner Graham Young. It follows his stranger-than-fiction story from the warning signs in his early years, to his much-disputed death in prison decades later. Murder at First Swipe looks at Stephen Port, who approached his victims on dating apps before drugging and raping them, then dumping their bodies on the street. It features exclusive interviews from his friends and lovers, and unseen correspondence from Port himself, who became known as the ‘Grindr Killer,’ that allowed him to murder. Both 90-minute docs are from Woodcut Media. Two-part series Scissor Sisters follows two young women, Charlotte and Linda Mulhall, who stabbed and beat to death their mother’s boyfriend before descending further into depravity by mutilating Farah Swaleh Noor’s body and then dumping his in Dublin’s Royal Canal. This doc revolves around the events which led to the murder of a man, who it was subsequently discovered was a predatory and violent rapist, and resulted in one of the most intensive police hunts in Irish history. Peninsula is the producer Breaking Dad: The Richard Lubbock Story is from Big Little Fish and follows the story of how a mild-mannered north London Jewish family man became Britain’s biggest meth dealer. Inspired by Lubbock’s son James’ memoir Breaking Dad, it looks at how Lubbock swapped his comfortable life for one of crime at a time when one of the most addictive drugs on the planet was making its way into the beating heartland of the London club scene. Lucie Blackman: Missing in Tokyo is from Future Studios and follows the disappearance of 20-year-old Blackman, who vanished on summer night in Tokyo in 2000. Her remains were found the following winter buried in a seaside cave. The story begins in Blackman’s quiet, leafy hometown of Sevenoaks and travels to Tokyo’s nightclub district, where she had been working as a ‘hostess.’ The tale includes mysterious cults, conmen, bizarre rituals, and ends with the revelation of an unspeakable crime by one of the world’s most prolific sex offenders. On the acquisitions front, The Heiress and the Heist is about the the 1974 Russborough House heist and how a gang led by Rose Dugdale, a former debutante from London’s high society, stole millions of pounds-worth of paintings. Confessions of a Crime Boss looks into the rampant gangland crime of late 20th century Ireland, and the power and influence held by the gangs who controlled the drugs trade during this turbulent time. It sees former crime boss John Gilligan discuss his past in the Irish underworld, including his trial for the murder of crime journalist Veronica Guerin. Jonathan Ford, Managing Director, AMR who brokered the deal with Amazon’s UK arm, said: “We are extremely pleased to announce this agreement with Prime Video. Viewers in the UK are fascinated by true crime series which continue to attract significant audiences.

The game averaged 13.51M viewers Friday, peaking at 17.43M at the top of the 6 p.m. ET hour. While that audience dwarfs in comparison to the behemoth numbers put up by the Thanksgiving games, it’s quite staggering when accounting for the fact that just over 9M tuned in to the Dolphins-Jets game last year. So far, it seems that Prime Video has delivered in bringing about a new annual pop culture event on the day after Thanksgiving, which is exactly what execs told Deadline was the hope last year when it launched. Watch on Deadline Of course, Amazon already embraces Black Friday so heavily on the retail side, it makes perfect sense that the company would have a live entertainment component over the holiday weekend to drive even more consumers to the platform. The year-over-year growth for the Black Friday game is likely thanks in part to the Chiefs, which are arguably the NFL’s biggest draw this season after back-to-back Super Bowl wins. The team eked out another win over the Raiders to secure an 11-1 record as they vie for another championship. However, Prime Video’s NFL viewership has been up across the board this season, marking a third year of substantial growth for the streamer’s pro football slate. Thursday Night Football has consistently outperformed all competing telecasts across broadcast and cable each week. In the week leading up to the Black Friday showdown, Thursday Night Football‘s Steelers-Browns game drew an even greater audience with 13.72M viewers. There was no comparable game, since that Thursday last year was Thanksgiving Day, but Prime Video did also say it was up 24% over the last time the Steelers and Browns faced off on TNF in 2022 when 11.03M tuned in. Aside from Friday’s game, there have been seven other matchups to exceed 13M viewers, with several weeks left in the regular season. That’s already blown past the five games that attracted 13M+ viewers in all of 2023. In its inaugural season, only one TNF game managed that type of audience. As of last week, this season is outpacing the last by 8%, averaging 13.25M. The Black Friday game isn’t included in those numbers, since it is a special presentation and not a regular Thursday Night Football presentation. According to Amazon’s data, TNF is up 38% over the 2022 inaugural season. As all the streamers race to perfect their live entertainment presentations, pro football in particular has been a big draw, considering it’s just about the only live programming that consistently captivates 10M+ viewers for a single telecast. Last year, Peacock scored a record-breaking audience for its streaming exclusive AFC Wild Card game, and this year Netflix is also looking to encroach into this territory with its upcoming Christmas Day Texans-Ravens game, featuring a performance from Beyoncé. Netflix does have a strong subscriber base that could spell huge numbers for the game, but it hasn’t established itself as a go-to platform for pro football the way that Amazon has over these last three years. The Christmas Day games are also a part of the regular season. Those tend to vary greatly in their ability to attract audiences, whereas the playoffs (like Peacock’s Wild Card presentation) stand a much better chance at doing so. None of that may matter though, if they’ve got Beyoncé to draw people in. It will be interesting to see how things shape up."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Sports -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Last year, he only had 72 hours. Marshall, a longtime second-in-command at NBCU’s ad-sales division, at about this time last year found himself unexpectedly in charge of the company’s “upfront” process — an annual sale of advertising that has in recent years generated approximately $7 billion in commitments from sponsors — after the abrupt departure of his colorful predecessor, Linda Yaccarino. She had served in the role since 2012 and surprised her corporate bosses and dozens of clients by taking a new job as CEO of X, the social-media hub once known as Twitter. NBC typically dazzles Madison Avenue with talk of BravoCon, “Sunday Night Football” and “Saturday Night Live.” Marshall was being asked to do just that when the chatter around the company was about anything else. Popular on Variety Within hours of Yaccarino’s departure becoming known, Marshall got a call from Mike Cavanagh, president of NBC’s corporate owner, Comcast. The executive “called and said, ‘This is not how we thought today would start, but you are the interim [leader], and you need to help us put on a really good show.” Marshall recalls. All of this happened in the middle of last year’s Hollywood writers strike as well, meaning Marshall had fewer scripted series to show off to the advertisers who gather each year to study NBC at Radio City Music Hall. “It started that crazy,” says Marshall in a recent interview. “So the rest of it has seemed pretty normal.” *** LISTEN: Mark Marshall Talks Olympics, Upfronts and Why NBCUniversal is Becoming a Technology Company on Variety‘s “Strictly Business” podcast *** Even so, Marshall, 54, is hip deep in an industry that is anything but stable. Audiences who once flocked to TV are migrating to streaming. Advertisers who once threw millions at any program on the NBC schedule are now working with much more precision and want to know how to find smaller pockets of likely customers, rather than constantly hurling their pitches at traditional TV crowds that continue to shrink. At first blush, this isn’t the guy who is supposed to talk to you about programmatic sales and streaming ad formats. Marshall got his start in Chicago, working for Pat Robertson’s Family Channel right out of college before it got snapped up by Rupert Murdoch in 1997. “My first day in the office, we all held hands and did a prayer before the meeting,” Marshall recalls. “I didn’t see that one coming, but it was a great place to learn.” Since that time, he’s helped manage ad-sales staffs across the U.S. for the former Turner Broadcasting and NBCUniversal, where he was previously known as the exec who had final say over ad sales for USA Network, “This Is Us” and some sports initiatives. Yet he is someone with whom marketers ranging from Apple to Toyota must reckon. NBCUniversal and Walt Disney Co. are viewed as the media companies with the strongest, most diversified portfolios of media assets in the 2024 “upfront” market. NBC may best be known for “Law & Order: SVU” and the Olympics, but it also has cable networks like MSNBC, USA and E! that, while still grappling with the effects of streaming, have more of a built-in community than some of their counterparts at Paramount Global or Warner Bros. Discovery. Its streaming outlet Peacock is not the biggest, but it has in recent months shown new strength by broadcasting an NFL Wild Card game with solid audience response. And NBCU has worked to make the process of buying digital and linear inventory together easier, rather than selling each separately. Viewing all video buys under a single umbrella will help, Marshall argues. Many advertisers worry — with justification — that they are running their commercials too many times in a bid to follow viewers as they jump from screen to screen. Buying inventory in cross-media packages, he argues, has in many cases at NBCU cut down on so-called campaign “burn-out,” and has driven better consumer response without having to expand the size of an ad commitment. RELATED CONTENT: Upfronts 2024 FULL COVERAGE He still faces a tough market. With Amazon Prime Video bringing a large batch of digital commercial inventory to the upfront for the first time, there’s suddenly a glut of the very stuff the networks are counting on to help them win business. That is likely to create more pressure to “rollback” what have in the past been sizable rate increases. And Netflix and YouTube are also eager to pick off ad dollars that flow to NBC. He is likely to make the pitch that NBCU’s programing is of decidedly higher quality than what advertisers will find elsewhere. “If you take digital as a whole, I think you’re doing a disservice to something like ‘Poker Face’ or an exclusive Wild Card game on Peacock compared to something long form on a made-for-advertiser site that runs video as well,” he says. “I think people are going to get more precise about what streaming means.” Senior media buyers say Marshall can navigate heady negotiations. “Mark is more than a sales exec. He is a true business partner who understands the value that his platforms can deliver for our clients, and he always finds solutions that benefit both parties,” says John Muszynski, chairman, Publicis Media Exchange, one of the nation’s biggest buyers of commercial inventory on behalf of clients. “He is a pro’s pro who operates with integrity — he is honest, fair and always true to his word.” SIGN UP for Variety’s free daily Upfronts newsletter Since taking the top job, however, Marshall has unexpectedly raised eyebrows. In one of his first big acts, he lured Allison Levin, a senior executive at Roku who was the company’s first ad-sales hire, to become a president at NBCU. To Madison Avenue, the move speaks volumes about NBC’s new ambitions to move quickly from being known simply as a seller of 30-second ad slots to a vendor of all the kinds of audiences — expectant mothers, car buyers, late-night soda drinkers — that one can find via digital means. He also played a role in reversing some initiatives launched by his predecessor, Under Yaccarino, NBCU took a very vocal role in pushing media agencies to adopt new kinds of audience-counting currencies other than Nielsen’s. NBCU had even struck a deal with one of the measurement giant’s upstart rivals, iSpot, and was pressing clients to sign up to make iSpot the next de facto tabulator of video eyeballs. Media agencies didn’t like being made to choose one type of yardstick, however, when so many have become readily available, and NBCU’s entreaties and nudges were beginning to wear. Under Marshall, NBCU scrapped much of a new measurement business it had launched, spearheaded by a former senior Nielsen executive, and instead began to work with in joint efforts with some of the other media companies. “He’s someone who knows how to work within a large system,” says Kelly Metz, chief investment officer for U.S. operations at Omnicom Group’s OMD. “Incremental change is how you do this. It’s not abrasive change, If you want to steer NBCUniversal” in the ad world, “it has to be incremental change that is widely embraced over time. He’s definitely the guy to do it.” Marshall says he’s asked NBCU’s ad sales team to view the work through a particular lens. “Our job is to make our advertisers’ marketing more effective today than it was yesterday,” he says. “It’s definitely narrowed our focus.” NBCUniversal remains interested in pushing for new ways of measuring video audiences, he says, but the company may be better able to make that happen by taking part in a joint industry committee that has been set up to help vet new audience technologies or working with other industry groups. “You probably haven’t heard from us directly as much” on measurement, he notes, but the company remains interested in pressing for change. “We are still very involved in it. I think our approach is that measurement is not a single media company solution. That’s actually what ‘walled gardens’ are,” he says, making reference to digital companies that in the recent past refused to have their audiences vetted by third parties. “We think the solution is finding something that works for marketers in different forms. Measuring a candy bar and a Mercedes the same way is not the way for any advertiser to buy their media.” And he is pushing NBCU deeper into the sale of so-called “strategic audiences,” or specific groups of consumers that are seen as more interested in a particular product, whether it be diapers or dog food. Levin’s arrival heralds the significance that type of sale has in the market, but NBC isn’t pulling out of TV, either. “You don’t want to lose the big reach of linear, but the precision of digital allows you to be much tighter in terms of …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strategy & Miscellaneous News -> General News & Strategy -> Misc.

Also impacted by layoffs in a consolidation move are multiple other Amazon MGM Studios teams, including Studio Marketing, Business Operations (Production, Post & Business Affairs) and Amazon MGM Studios Distribution teams, as well as the company’s Local Originals business. Watch on Deadline Amazon Studios Head Jennifer Salke and Brearton just addressed the organizational changes and the layoffs in internal memos, also revealing a consolidation of the Amazon Studios and MGM theatrical distribution units (You can read them at the bottom of the story.) The goal for the team led by Sloane, who took up the role of EVP, MGM Scripted TV in November 2022, is that the division will be able to produce more premium series in the vein of Netflix’s Wednesday, Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale and FX’s Fargo, for third party broadcasters as well as series for MGM+. Michael Wright will continue as head of MGM+ and will report to Brearton as a part of the newly created group. However, Nancy Cotton who is EVP, Head of Scripted Programming for MGM+, has been affected. She joined the company in 2018 when MGM+ was known as Epix and was boss Michael Wright’s first major executive hire. She has been responsible for series such as Godfather of Harlem, Julian Fellowes’ Belgravia, Ed Burns’ Bridge and Tunnel and Adrien Brody-fronted Chapelwaite. Arturo Interian, EVP, Current Scripted Programming, who has been with the company since 2019, Marcy Kaplan, Head of Production for MGM+, who joined in October 2022, and Rob Hochberg, VP of Development & Production, Scripted TV at MGM, who has been there 13 years are also understood to be affected. Kaplan is understood to be staying for a bit to help with continuity. Other impacted scripted execs are said to include Amy Suh, Senior Development Executive, Co-Productions, Amazon MGM Studios, Vanessa Martinez – Creative Executive, First Look & Overall Deals, and Sonya Strich – Development Executive, Genre Series at Amazon Studios. Chris Castallo, who has been with the company since 2018, is also leaving. He joined the company as Head of Unscripted Television for Amazon Studios but last year, we revealed that he was moving to the streamer’s scripted division. Elsewhere, on the unscripted side, we gather most of Amazon Studios’ U.S. unscripted programming team is safe, although Uri Fleming, Head of Business Affairs, Unscripted is affected. Fleming has been with the company for seven years. Internationally, the cuts seem to have affected Amazon Studios’ Canadian team with a number of executives let go. International scripted teams are also thought to be impacted. Deadline understands that many of the employees affected turned up or logged on to work this morning to an email informing them of the layoffs and that there is an “HR video call” later this morning that will reveal severance packages. Here is Salke’s email to staff: Team, I am really proud of how much we have grown and accomplished over the past year. We’ve brought our audiences world class, compelling series and movies across the globe. However, like any organization, we continue to look deeply at our business, self-reflect on our strategies, and be insightful about our investments across Amazon MGM Studios, Prime Video and Freevee. While we will continue to make significant content investments and deliver a robust slate, it’s also important that we continue to focus on becoming more operationally efficient and coordinated in driving success across our business. As Mike shared this morning, we have made difficult decisions to eliminate some roles across Amazon MGM Studios. With that in mind, I wanted to share some strategic changes we are making as a business. Firstly, we have consolidated the Amazon Studios and MGM theatrical distribution teams. Having one team will allow us to look across our content and decide the best release strategy for each title. This team will remain under Kevin Wilson’s leadership and operate as the Amazon MGM Studios Theatrical Distribution team. Chris Brearton will be integrating Lindsay Sloane’s MGM Scripted Television team alongside MGM+ and MGM Unscripted with a mission to continue to make best in class content. Lindsay Sloane and Barry Poznick’s teams will continue to work closely with the studios teams in developing for Prime Video and also will continue to produce for outside networks and streamers. Chris and I will share more detail very shortly. In the effort to consolidate and find more efficiencies, we have made other organizational changes which have lead to some loss of roles across multiple Amazon MGM Studios teams, including Studio Marketing, Business Operations (Production, Post & Business Affairs) and Amazon MGM Studios Distribution teams. Finally, we have taken a deep look at our Local Originals business and are focusing our resources in the places where we believe they can have the largest impact for customers. All impacted employees in the Americas have been notified this morning (PST), and most other regions will be notified on these headcount reductions and changes in strategy by the end of the week. We are following local processes, which may include time for consultation with employee representative bodies, possibly resulting in longer timelines to communicate in some countries. I know this news is difficult and impacts you all in different ways. We encourage you to reach out to My HR with questions and remember that our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is available 24/7 for free and confidential help. Change is always hard and decisions to lose valued employees are not ones we take lightly. As shared this morning, we remain very optimistic about the long-term future of Amazon MGM Studios and continue to make significant investments towards making Prime the most loved entertainment hub for customers globally. For those teams who have been impacted by these strategic changes and headcount reductions, I want to thank you all for the hard work and results you have driven for our business. I know this is not an easy time for any of you and encourage you to reach out to your leaders or our HRBP teams if you have any questions — we are all here to support you. My leadership team and I will be setting an All Hands at the end of Q1 to discuss the go forward priorities for the Studio in more detail, as we move forward into 2024 and beyond. Jen Here is the joint email from Brearton and Salke: Team, In addition to the high-quality and broadly appealing movies and series produced by Amazon MGM Studios for customers on Prime Video, we produce critically acclaimed and culture-defining series for MGM+ and third party platforms. MGM+ has showcased series such as Godfather of Harlem, From, Billy the Kid and the upcoming Hotel Cocaine. Our productions for third partners include Emmy award nominated series such as Wednesday, The Handmaid’s Tale and Fargo. In order bring together our creative resources in this area, today we will combine the MGM Scripted Television team with the MGM+ Productions team to form a unified television creative group. This group will be led by Lindsay Sloane and will focus on continuing to produce premium scripted series for third party partners, as well as new series for the thriving MGM+ platform. Michael Wright will continue as the Head of MGM+ and will be responsible for all programming and greenlight decisions for the MGM + platform. Lindsay and Michael will report to Chris Brearton, VP Corporate Strategy, Prime Video & Studios, as a part of the newly created group, which will also include MGM Alternative Television under the continued leadership of Barry Poznick. These teams will also work closely with Vernon Sanders at Amazon MGM Studios on potential series for distribution on Prime Video. As a result of these changes, there will be some roles eliminated within the MGM team. I’m writing to let you know that all impacted employees have been notified this morning (PST). We recognize this news is difficult. Please know that we do not take these decisions lightly. We encourage you to reach out to My HR with questions and remember that our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is available 24/7 for free and confidential help.

As he approached what was then known as the KidsZone — the park’s earliest strategy for catering to their youngest guests with classic IP attractions like Fievel’s Playland, Woody Woodpecker’s Nuthouse Coaster and Curious George Goes to Town — the sound of a child shouting caught his attention. Around a marquee tied to a DreamWorks meet-and-greet, a young girl around 10 years old was begging her mother to get a picture in front of a poster of Shrek. “People grew up with Shrek when they were kids. Now they’re having their own families, and what do they do? They sit down and watch the movie that they loved as a kid with their kid,” the creative director, Universal Creative, Universal Orlando Resort, tells The Hollywood Reporter. “With a 20-year-old franchise, there’s also always talk about are people going to relate to this, but... the great thing about Shrek is that it is loved by multiple generations.” Related Stories While the Oscar-winning green ogre and his massive box office success helped situate DreamWorks Animation as an industry-leading studio, Orion also points to Trolls and Kung Fu Panda — both with themed villages in DreamWorks Land — as similarly notable film franchises that have left an indelible mark on pop culture. Both brands have turned single successful features into big-screen franchises, garnering an aggressive catalog of merchandise and their own TV spinoffs. Their newest big-screen installments, along with a Shrek spinoff, have all been released in recent succession: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022), Trolls Band Together (2023) and Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024). (The Oscar-nominated Last Wish arrived just a year before Universal was crowned the highest-grossing movie studio, taking the title from Disney for the first time since 2015 with the help of the billion-dollar box office of Illumination’s Super Mario Bros. Movie.) “Enduring is really a great word because these characters are just so beloved,” says Orion while discussing why these franchises were selected to head-up the new land for what will likely be several decades. “One of the things that is so powerful about the DreamWorks brand is that they are everyman characters, Shrek, Po, Poppy, Branch. They’re all these lovable, relatable, big-hearted characters that are larger than life, but in a very human way. Then there’s the sort of irreverent humor.” Like with the creation of Illumination’s Minion Land — its meet and greet Illumination Theater and family-friend rides like Minions at Villain-Con opening less than a year ago in the former home of Shrek 4-D — DreamWorks Land’s team spent several years working to capture the spirit behind the studio’s stories in a dynamic way that’s at once intergenerational and specifically for families with children ages three to 10. “Dean and the creative team at Universal Orlando Resort absolutely nailed it with the creation of DreamWorks Land,” says Michael Vollman, executive vice president of marketing at DreamWorks Animation. “Each distinct area truly feels like you’re walking right into those films.” When it officially opens to the public on June 14, guests can visit Shrek’s Swamp for Little Ogres, an immersive space featuring a 39-foot high cottage, a meet and greet with the titular character, Fiona, and Donkey, a (farting) outhouse slide, an animatronic Pinocchio, splash pads, and suspension bridges. A call to Shrek the Third’s comically long King Harold death sequence, which is capped off with a rendition of Guns N’ Roses’ “Live or Let Die,” the Swamp Symphony features a recreation of Fiona’s father’s mausoleum, around which young guests can interact with lily pads that activate musical frogs. “That’s our DreamWorks wink,” says Orion. “The kids are actually dancing on King Harold’s grave.” At Trolls village, the Trollercoaster’s caterpillar Caterbus takes riders and their favorite trolls (Poppy, Tiny and twins Satin and Chenille) on the run from evil spiders. The Kung Fu Panda section serves as a return to the animated universe for Orion, who worked on the films before joining the Universal Creative team to build Kung Fu Panda Land in Beijing. “That was quite a thing to build a theme park through a pandemic and in China,” he says. “It was definitely a great lesson in theme park construction that I took a lot from to come here.” In the area, guests practice their fighting skills at Po’s Kung Fu Training Camp, a wet and dry play area. Like several other IP-inspired attractions at the park that feature the on-screen talent from their films (think The Mummy and Wizarding World), this experience features around 80 different lines voiced by Mr. Ping’s James Hong. Many of the original KidsZone attractions had been with the park almost since its opening over 30 years ago. DreamWorks Land, Orion says, was built with the same longevity in mind. So while “villages” largely focus on longer-established film franchises, Orion built a meet-and-greet space where, presently, Gabby from DreamWorks Animation TV’s hit preschool series Gabby’s Dollhouse will appear for her young fans. “There are a lot of people at DreamWorks and Universal that are very excited about Gabby’s Dollhouse and the success that show has had, but you can’t just drop Gabby into the middle of Trolls,” Orion says. “We worked a lot with our entertainment partners and arrived at what we call a flex stage, right behind the marquee, where we could have different DreamWorks characters. If at a certain point down the road a whole new franchise emerges that is really successful, they can change out the backdrops and put a whole new IP in there.” The land is also home to the new DreamWorks Imagination Celebration live show, which includes 360-degree media, animated performers, dancers, singers, and puppets, and takes over for the once-popular (and non-Universal IP) A Day in the Park with Barney. Calling up the cloudy imagery found in DreamWorks’ logo and curtain raiser (which got its own update in 2022), this story follows two friends who return to the spot where they met as kids, re-engaging their imaginations as they cloud gaze at a number of DreamWorks characters. “It’s a 20-minute, I would say, Broadway-level experience where kids are going to be able to sing, dance and, along with their adults, recapture their imagination,” says Mike Aiello, senior director, Entertainment Creative Development, Universal Orlando Resort. Aiello and his team were charged with revamping several of the park’s other entertainment experiences to open this summer. “In 2025 we are going to be opening Epic Universe,” he tells THR. “The opportunity we want to provide in 2024 is that we allow our present day brands to exist, allow a sprinkling of the brands that will exist in 2025, and at the same time, revisit some of the brands that were a part of the universal experience in major ways.” This June the fourth Hogwarts Castle nighttime show will debut, a divergence from their Christmas and Halloween projections, as well as the original sorting hat storyline that launched with the parks in Orlando and Los Angeles. The newest seven-minute projection is an answer to whether the entertainment team could successfully tap into “a more expansive breadth of the entirety of the [Harry Potter] IP,” Aiello says. Featuring a new arrangement of the films’ existing compositions and recorded at Abbey Road with the London Symphony Orchestra, Hogwarts Always is a 4K experience on the castle exterior. The story itself will go beyond the journeys of Harry and his friends, referencing popular narrative touchstones and existing elements of the Wizarding World. That includes an acceptance letter and Kings Cross train ride; a trip to Diagon Alley and adventure in the Forbidden Forest; a Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin; the Marauders Map; three courses, including Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts; and Dumbeldore’s announcement of the House Cup winner, complete with four different endings. It’s all part of the park’s growing approach to making fans feel more personally immersed within the magical universe. “This is the great thing about immersive entertainment,” says Orion. “You can actually create this feeling like you stepped into the movie, that you’ve transcended that fourth wall.” CineSational: A Symphonic Spectacular will serve as the park’s newest lagoon show, replacing the Cinematic Celebration that opened in 2018. Going bigger than its predecessor, the 22-minute presentation features 228 fountains and 1600 individual fountain nozzles that create a “beautiful, moving colorful palette that offers a lot of energy,” says Aiello. Additionally, approximately 660 drones will be divided between “full blown” sculptures in the sky and lighting elements that will be “fairly up close and personal” to bystanders. CineSational is broken into thematic sections like action and adventure, heart and friendship, danger and peril, and will feature the musical themes from each property. Jurassic World, The Mummy, Fast and Furious, Shrek, and Trolls will all make appearances alongside nods to Epic Universe properties How to Train Your …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strategy & Miscellaneous News -> General News & Strategy -> Strategy"}]}

The pickup of Shifting Gears was fully expected. While not too surprising, the pass on Forgive & Forget was not. ABC does have comedy shelf space: By the end of this season, the network will be down to one returning series, flagship single-camera half-hour Abbott Elementary, as The Conners is set for an abbreviated seventh and final season. Both Shifting Gears and Forgive & Forget are in the cost-effective multi-camera format and feature popular ABC comedy stars in Home Improvement and Last Man Standing‘s Allen and Modern Family‘s Burrell. As Deadline reported, ABC was so determined to get Allen back on the air that it developed two scripts for him to choose from. The network proceeded with a series pickup even as the pilot’s writers, executive producers and showrunners Mike Scully and Julie Thacker Scully have stepped down, and a role in the pilot is being recast. RELATED: 2024-25 ABC New Series Meanwhile, Forgive & Forget brought in Modern Family co-creator Christopher Lloyd to consult, reuniting with Burrell. But the project also faced challenges. The role of the son was recast after the table read. The pilot came in OK and had internal support but, with ABC’s bar for comedies very high as the network has shifted its business to drama procedurals and unscripted, that probably was not enough. And then there was the subject matter as Forgive & Forget deals with Alzheimer’s. From Punky Brewster duo Eugene Garcia-Cross and Robin Shorr and 20th Television, the project follows perennial life of the party Hank (Burrell). After an unexpected diagnosis, Hank reconnects with his responsible adult son Ben in hopes of making new memories together. RELATED: 2024-25 ABC Pilots & Series Orders I hear the topic, while handled deftly, might have felt a little darker for broadcast TV. Forgive & Forget was inspired by Garcia-Cross’ experiences of caring for a parent with Alzheimer’s, and the show hoped to destigmatize a disease afflicting millions. While the pilot is not moving forward, Disney remains committed to getting a series with Burrell going, and I hear talks are underway for other opportunities.

Comedian and actress Ward is starring in The Office Australia, one of the most hotly anticipated series outside of the U.S., marking the first time a woman has played the iconic (mis)manager role that Ricky Gervais first made famous on the BBC. Sarah Christie, Senior Development Executive at Amazon MGM Studios in Australia, which is working on The Office for the Prime Video streaming service, is aware of the weight of expectation and the need to try something new. “It is huge, iconic IP,” she told Deadline. With NBC’s Michael Scott joining Gervais’ David Brent in the annals of TV comedy history, and other incarnations in countries as wide apart as Germany and Chile, the challenge is sizeable. “We want to honor the legacy but also provide something Australian to give it that local flavor,” said Christie. “There are 14 versions of The Office out there and we’re the first where the boss is a woman... And she is just as flawed, worthy and in love with herself as the other ones.” Watch on Deadline The series, which Amazon is making with BBC Studios Australia and New Zealand and Bunya Entertainment, has wrapped shooting, with a launch date announcement expected to come later this year. “Felicity Ward is just phenomenal, and we can’t wait for people to meet her Hannah,” said the Sydney-based Christie. “She’s brought her all to this role.” Details of the plot are being kept under wraps, but the impact of the pandemic plays into the scripts. “We have the wealth of the original series from Ricky Gervais that everyone loves and reveres around the world, and that’s a great starting block to build on,” said Christie. “The office itself has changed a lot in the past five years and that was our starting off point — is it a place people want to be anymore? Hannah wants to prove to her staff that it is. Head office wants to send everyone home to save money but she says, ‘Absolutely not’ and wants everyone in full time. She loves her staff and wants to keep them together.” Christie added the series will have “characters front and center you will recognize and some we have created.” The ensemble cast includes Edith Poor, Steen Raskopoulos, Shari Sebbens, Josh Thomson, Jonny Brugh, Pallavi Sharda and Susan Ling Young. Prime Video’s Australian ambitions The Office Australia is just one numerous original series and films coming out of the Amazon Australia production operation. Earlier this week, we revealed Prime Video had ordered a second season of comedy crime drama Deadloch, which stars Madeleine Sami and Kate Box as a pair of mismatched detectives. The second run will move the action to Australia’s Northern Territory, where two famous local icons are discovered dead in a remote town, flinging open a new “sweatier, stickier” investigation. Also reprising their season 1 roles are Nina Oyama and Alicia Gardiner. The series, from the Australian writing duo known as ‘The Kates’ (Kate McCartney and Kate McLennan), was initially pitched to Amazon as “funny Broadchurch,” and season one took on tropes from Scandi noirs, akin to the Olivia Colman and David Tennant ITV drama. Season two of Deadloch will “tonally take cues from Australian classics such as Crocodile Dundee — with a gothic twist,” said Christie. “The Kates know what they want to say, but can also deliver a hugely entertaining ride while cutting to the core of themes such as race, gender and power,” she added. “That speaks to them coming out of comedy writing and sketch shows initially, taking on a much bigger world and balancing that with a gripping mystery. It’s a very delicate balance tonally and it’s something on season 1 we spoke about from script stage to final delivery.” Season 2 is expected to launch next year, with Guesswork Television and OK Great Productions making the show, with the support of Screen Queensland and Screen Territory. Christie said the show is an example of how local Australian stories can cut through internationally. “Our shows are seen in 240 territories around the world, which is such a great opportunity for local creatives,” she added. “We really do think that to be successful globally, we have to be speaking locally first. “We have to speak directly to Australians, and Deadloch is such a prime example of that working — we had to create a dictionary of local Australian slang for our post teams. There are quite a lot of ‘c-bombs’ in there, and Australian towns that we known Australians want to see. But great stories do travel.” There has been much debate over recent years about whether Australia is being used by global streamers mainly as a production hub rather than a creative hub (only this week Screen Producers Australia criticized the government for delaying setting a levy of streamers while simultaneously increasing the Location Offset, which is largely designed to attract overseas productions). The fact Deadloch represents Prime Video’s thirtieth commission in five years — an average of about six productions a year — suggests Amazon is, at least for the moment, committed to the country. Orders have included Sarah Lambert miniseries The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart, the Caitlin Stasey-starring comedy series Class of 07 and the Nathan Ramos-Park and Shuang Hu romcom Five Blind Dates. “We don’t work to [quotas], and we’re really driven by the material,” said Christie. “We are quite curated and we want to put the full force of the studio behind everything we do. Creative partnerships are really key to our success. We’re lucky to have such a wealth of talent in Australia and are lucky to be working with the best producers, writers and directors. We think about it holistically – quality over quantity. The dream when we look at the service aggregately is that we’ve made something for everyone in Australia.” Christie certainly knows the local industry’s tastes. Besides working across all creative aspects of development, production and post-production at Amazon, she was a co-producer on Stan and Sundance Now’s Black Snow and worked across projects such as SBS’s New Gold Mountain, Unjoo Moon’s I Am Woman, Foxtel’s Fighting Season, Leigh Whannell’s Upgrade (produced with Blumhouse), ABC and Sunance show Cleverman and Neil Armfield’s Holding the Man. She also served as development producer on James Vaughan’s debut feature film, Friends and Strangers, having begun her career an entertainment lawyer at Media Arts Lawyers. Another upcoming series is Top End Bub, a TV spin-off of 2019 romcom Top End Wedding, which has just wrapped shooting in Darwin and Adelaide. Miranda Tapsell, who is also the co-writer, reprises her film role along with on-screen husband Gwilym Lee. After the marriage in the film, Lauren (Tapsell), a dynamic Indigenous lawyer, and her baker husband Ned (Lee), have abandoned city life for the Top End (the local name for Australia’s Northern Territories) to raise Lauren’s recently-orphaned eight-year-old niece. “This is a quintessentially Australian story, with so much warmth, heart and humor,” said Christie, who previously worked at the show’s producer, Goalpost Pictures, where she was an exec on Top End Wedding. “Pretty much all the cast came back for the TV version, and it was great to get the band back together. It is looking beautiful — the rushes really show off the Top End and there is really lots of warmth.” The other buzzy title on the slate is The Narrow Road to the Deep North, the Sony-produced war series starring Euphoria‘s Jacob Elordi. Set against the shadows of World War II, the drama tells the epic story of Lieutenant-Colonel Dorrigo Evans (Elordi) and how his all-too-brief love affair with Amy Mulvaney (Odessa Young) shaped his life. The story is told over multiple time periods, providing a love story to sustain audiences through the darkest of times, an intimate character study illustrating the strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity, and an investigation into a marriage and an unforgettable love affair. “It has just wrapped production,” revealed Christie. “There is talent across the board, and Jacob Elordi is just brilliant in it. It is a meaty role and an epic story. Again, it’s a very authored approach to television.” As for whether Prime Video Australia is interested in co-productions, Christie pointed out that Narrow Road and Top End Bub would be sold internationally, with Amazon holding Aussie rights, while Deadloch rolls out in all territories. “We’ll do the model that fits best,” she added. Wonder if Hannah Howard will take the same approach in her chaotic office?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> International -> General News & Strategy"}]}

None of Carano’s comments reference Defendants, Star Wars, or The Mandalorian, or had anything to do with Defendants. Carano’s claims do not seek to impose any message on Defendants or to change Defendants’ speech in any fashion.” Watch on Deadline “Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss should be denied,” Carano’s team states, noting “the First Amendment does not give Defendants the carte blanche authority to terminate Carano for expressing her personal beliefs.” A hearing on the dismissal motion by Disney and the other defendants against former MMA star Carano has been set for June 12 in DTLA before Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett. Just a touch under three years after Carano was pink slipped by Disney and didn’t see her Mandalorian contract renewed for what Lucasfilm said were “her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities,” the actress who played bounty hunter Cara Dune for two seasons on the series sued the once again Bob Iger-run entertainment giant Star Wars division of Disney and Huckleberry Industries. The actress is looking for an injunction to get her Mandalorian gig back. On that note, Carano and Disney do agree that the straw that seemingly broke the Mouse House’s back was when the actress shared a TikTok post in 2021 that looked to compare the current divided political climate in America to Nazi Germany. In his own ongoing dust-up with Disney, who pulled their ads from portions of X over ill-considered reweets, Musk came out pretty quick to admit he was paying Carano’s legal bills. As a part of her action, Carano called out what she saw as a sexist double standard by the so-called progressive Disney to allow the likes of Pedro Pascal and Mark Hamill to post on social media over and over comparing Trump to Hitler. As always in these things, there was some accompanying sparring on social media. Last month, things moved back to the courts last month. On April 10, Disney, Lucasfilm and Huckleberry filed their motion to dismiss. In that document, the defendants proclaimed that Carano lost her Star Wars series job in 2021 because of her social media choices “to publicly trivialize the Holocaust by comparing criticism of political conservatives to the annihilation of millions of Jewish people—notably, not ‘thousands’—was the final straw for Disney.” Stating that Carabo’s posts and tweets did not jive with Disney’s values, the company last month wanted the initial filing gone The basis for their argument is that “Disney has a constitutional right not to associate its artistic expression with Carano’s speech, such that the First Amendment provides a complete defense to Carano’s claims.” A stance Carano disagrees with, no suprise. “As to the specifics of Carano’s Complaint, and contrary to Defendants’ assertion, Carano did not disparage anyone, and she certainly did not ‘publicly trivialize the Holocaust,’ let alone ‘grotesquely’ do so,” the response filed this week says. Judge Garnett will hear arguments from both sides next month. No longer packing on the Disney dollars, Carano has had a good run the past couple of years with The Daily Wire’s production company. Linking with the conservative media outlet, she has appeared in Terror on the Prairie and as a Secret Service agent in the Breitbart News-distributed My Son Hunter.

But when he took a drug test in Monaco in the summer of 1990, his career was upended, and his life was forever changed.

For years now, the growth of esports has been one of the defining stories of entertainment – financially, socially, and culturally. And at the center of all that growth has been FaZe Clan, an organization that’s gone from the brainchild of a few gamers streaming their play on the internet to publicly traded company with teams and players all around the globe competing professionally in an array of games. The film explores questions about the costs of their rapid growth and extraordinary success – specifically in the form of the impact on the founders of the team, a number of whom have struggled with significant personal problems. And even as FaZe has come to encompass stars and performers from the traditional sports and entertainment worlds, even in the wake of the company’s public offering, the financial viability of the whole enterprise hardly appears stable.

The move is the latest in what appears to be a grab for ad veterans to run the latest battles of the media industry’s streaming wars. NBCUniversal recently snared Alison Levin, a Roku veteran, and set her in charge of winning ad support for some of the company’s biggest properties, including sales tied to sports and national TV. Netflix in 2022 poached Peter Naylor, a veteran of NBCU and Hulu, to help run its nascent sales effort for an ad-supported tier.

It’s not that people have fallen out of love with the big screen, he says, they’ve just gotten out of practice. In fact, in the 30-plus years O’Meara has worked in the business, he’s had a front-row seat as the audiences who habitually went to the movies turned to streaming services instead. “I’ll see people at the grocery store, and they’ll tell me, ‘You have nothing we want to see.’ I don’t blame them on certain weekends,” says O’Meara, who operates two venues in Fairfax County. “Nobody denies they consume content. That’s never been the issue. We’re competing with the convenience of the couch. Good movies sell no matter what the hell is going on. But we need more of them.” Popular on Variety This year, total revenues are expected to reach $30.5 billion globally, down more than 10% from 2023, which was itself nearly 20% off pre-pandemic levels. Domestic admissions, an even better gauge of the movie theater industry’s hold on the culture at large, are expected to hit approximately 800 million. In contrast, before COVID upended the movie business, cinemas were averaging roughly 1.3 billion admissions annually. “A lot of the gains we’re seeing at the box office are due to higher ticket prices,” says Eric Handler, managing director at Roth Capital Partners. “Theaters need to do a better job of promoting the cinema experience and getting people to come back.” Over the past few years, the movie business has suffered one setback after another. First, COVID shuttered theaters for months, prompting a wave of release-date delays, and halted filming on major movies, which only resumed with costly new health measures in place that added millions to budgets. Then, 2023 saw historic writers and actors strikes that scuttled production once again, resulting in another monthslong work stoppage as a fresh crop of films saw their opening weekends pushed back. All of this has left theaters with fewer films to showcase, which analysts believe is partly the cause of the decline in year-over-year revenues. “We’re still in a post-pandemic recovery mode,” says Eric Wold, an analyst with B. Riley Securities. “It is taking time to get people to return to theaters and to have a slate that has breadth and diversity.” So, what worked? Sequels and special effects-heavy adventures dominated the 2024 box office, while family-friendly films finally rebounded in a major way. Nine of the 10 highest-grossing worldwide releases were part of franchises (“Inside Out 2,” “Deadpool & Wolverine,” “Despicable Me 4,” “Moana 2” and “Dune: Part II” among them), while “Wicked,” the only original movie among the top earners, was adapted from a wildly popular 20-year-old Broadway musical that leans heavily on “Wizard of Oz” lore. That was in stark contrast to the previous year, when the top three releases — “Barbie,” “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” and “Oppenheimer” — arrived without a roman numeral in the title. “It seems like everything Hollywood is offering is a sequel, a prequel or a reboot,” says Jeff Bock, an analyst with Exhibitor Relations. “But can you blame the studios? That’s what audiences are feasting on.” When studios did try to launch original properties — or at least to produce movies like “The Fall Guy” (a reboot of a long-forgotten ’80s show) that weren’t part of long-established film series — they mostly struck out. Take “If,” Paramount and John Krasinski’s $110 million fantasy comedy, which faltered at the box office with $190 million globally, or Apple’s “Fly Me to the Moon,” a Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson-led “meet cute” that tapped out at $42.2 million worldwide — less than half its $100 million budget. Although the rise of streaming services like Netflix and the collapse of home entertainment offerings like DVDs have scrambled the economics of moviemaking, here’s some critical context: Exhibitors keep roughly 50% of ticket sales, so movies must double their production budgets and marketing expenses to make money theatrically. The reception of these films doesn’t make studios eager to take risks on properties that are untested. “Audiences say they want original titles, yet they’re doubling down and supporting the safer options of titles they know,” says Disney‘s executive VP of global theatrical distribution Tony Chambers. Many follow-up films, however, boasted grosses that rivaled those of pre-pandemic blockbusters. Disney, after a miserable 2023, enjoyed a considerable revival as “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool & Wolverine” easily topped $1 billion, while “Moana 2” will near or even surpass that benchmark. All told, Disney will have fielded three of the five highest-grossing films of the year — the first time it’s done that in the post-COVID era. Meanwhile, Universal and Illumination’s “Despicable Me 4” got pretty close to the billion-dollar club, earning $969 million, and Warner Bros. and Legendary’s “Dune: Part Two” notably outgrossed its predecessor, 2021’s “Dune: Part One,” with $714 million in sales. Those movies also accounted for a greater percentage of the overall box office. In 2024, at this point, the five biggest movies accounted for 32% of the marketplace. A decade ago, in 2014, the year’s top five releases made up 15% of total revenues. In contrast, major movies that failed to connect with moviegoers were unmitigated disasters. The year’s biggest flops include “Joker: Folie à Deux,” netting $206 million worldwide on a $200 million budget, director Kevin Costner’s “Horizon: An American Saga — Part One,” which earned $38 million despite costing $100 million, and Lionsgate’s video game adaptation “Borderlands,” which cost $110 million to make and only brought in $32.9 million. “I’m sobered by the fact that the marketplace has evolved in a way where there’s a big gap between the have and have-nots,” says Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. “The ones that work are bigger than before, and the ones that miss are bigger than before.” What’s also missing, Goldstein says, is the kind of modestly successful singles and doubles that once powered the industry. “You used to be able to have a middle class that made up the bulk of films,” he laments. “That has shrunk.” Strikes and pandemics aren’t the only things that have scrambled the cinema business. The industry has also had to grapple with the changes taking place across Hollywood: namely, corporate mergers that have left the business with fewer stand-alone studios (see Disney’s acquisition of Fox) producing movies and major shifts in strategy (take Warner Bros.’ tumultuous sale to first AT&T and later Discovery) that have disrupted the old order. There’s cautious optimism that Skydance’s pending purchase of Paramount Global will at least keep one more film studio intact, given that a sale to a direct competitor like Sony could have resulted in cutbacks and even fewer movies for theaters to screen. But there’s also a realization that this era of consolidation in the entertainment industry isn’t over yet, as studios struggle to find ways to generate profits at a time when streaming and changing consumer habits have shrunk margins. “This industry is going through a sorting-out process, and we just hope that these mergers don’t impact the number of movies that are available for us to screen,” says Michael O’Leary, chief executive officer of the National Association of Theatre Owners, an exhibition trade group. “We need compelling movies to show for all 12 months of the year.” He’s pushing studios to increase the volume of their releases and to consider debuting more films against each other. The theater business was thrilled by the decision of Universal, Paramount and Disney to release “Wicked,” “Gladiator II” and “Moana 2” in quick succession, noting that the influx of exciting new movies grew overall revenues instead of cannibalizing ticket sales. It also inspired a wave of positive media coverage that applied a veneer of cool to a business that’s often depicted as being in dire straits. “Competition is good for everyone,” O’Leary argues. “It draws more attention to the box office, and it builds excitement. We can handle more than one wide release a weekend.” Quality control may be an important ingredient in the expansion of certain franchises, but impressing tastemakers isn’t always a recipe for success. Box office observers note that it’s no longer enough for a film to be good or even great to pack theaters. After all, “The Fall Guy” and “Furiosa” were well reviewed and still failed to pack a punch. Now, a movie needs to permeate the zeitgeist and have audiences feeling FOMO if they don’t go to the multiplex to see it. That’s partly how “Wicked” bucked the odds and became the rare Broadway adaptation to connect with moviegoers, many of whom wore pink and green, the signature colors of the film’s witchy protagonists, to the cinema. “We’re all quite clear-eyed about the fact that you need to create a sense of urgency to get films to work at the box office,” says Peter Cramer, president of …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Film -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Some audience members at the panel, may have been asking the same thing. Co-commissioned by the BBC and NBCUniversal as part of their international formats pact, “Destination X” is designed as their weekly water cooler replacement for “The Traitors,” whose 11 territory launches in 2023 were the most of any format in the world, according to “Tracking the Giants,” a report by analysts K7. Presented Saturday morning at MipTV “Tracking the Giants” branded “The Traitors” Format of the Year. So its follow-up has been greeted with huge anticipation, an industry audience packing out the boutique auditorium Palais Stage at Cannes Palais des Festivals during MipFormats to attend a panel, ‘Destination X’ Case Study – Building a Global Format With NBCUniversal and BBC. Popular on Variety What they didn’t get, however – and what many were surely looking for – were visuals of the new show, any instance of its tone, pace, style or specific manifestations of scale. Featuring Ed Havard, NBCUniversal SVP non-scripted and Syeda Irtizaali, BBC editor of unscripted, what the panel did deliver, however, was a sense of the excitement of the business model behind the new format. An event reality adventure competition, “Destination X” sees around 10-12 contestants – the number doesn’t seem as yet to be sure – driven around different international destinations on a bus with blacked-out windows. They play a series of challenges and are fed endless red-herrings and a few clues to guess their location. The contestant who marks an “X” on the map furthest from the real location is eliminated from the show. “It is really, really compelling, really fun to watch and a very different approach to travel adventure,” Irtizaali said at the panel. “It ticks every box, reality, travelogue, play along, a guessing game and we hadn’t really seen anything like that,” Havard added. “Destination X” does confirm, however – and in line with “The Traitors”– a model for co-operation in a world where money is tight but audiences crave big Saturday-night-style event shows. NBCU and BBC teamed to buy U.S and U.K. adaptation rights to the original show, which come from Belgian producer Geronimo and distributor Be-Entertainment. Though NBCU and BBC will develop their own versions, both are made by the same U.K. production company, Twofour (Apple TV+’s “The Reluctant Traveller”), the U.S. version having just been picked up to series by NBCU. Twofour won a tender for what Havard described as “one of the largest unscripted commissions globally this year” featuring “one of the most highly subscribed tender processes, ever, ever undertaken in the U.K.” “It’s also a massively ambitious show,” he added, “the tender run by two massive broadcasters coming together to find a single partner. That has never, ever happened before.” Both formats’ production by the same company offers of course huge economies of scale and creative synergies sparking between Twofour, the BBC and NBCU. Scale in itself does not guarantee success. “The Traitors’” human heart is in part how it offered a very contemporary question of the degree to which people are prepared to betray others for their own success. What are the large Zeitgeist-infused questions coursing through “Destination X” remains to be seen. But the partners look to be on the case. Some of their questions about “Destination X” are the same that the BBC asks of any format, Irtizaali noted: “Will the narrative arc be really compelling and have enough twists and turns and surprises and delights and rug-pulls that that will keep audiences interested and excited, but prove authentic and doesn’t feel like the hand of the producer is too involved?” Also, “Have you created a world that audiences can get really immersed in? And what are the emotional arcs of the characters? These are drama tropes. It’s about very high production values, very high standards of storylines and narrative arcs but with an authentic cast and authentic reactions. I keep calling this ‘prestige reality’ in the hope that it catches on.” “Destination X” will learn lessons from “Traitors,” Irtizaali and Havard reflected. “The thing we probably learnt the most is when we think about things at a very early stage together, at the development stage, it really, really, really pays dividends,” said Irtizaali. “The ability for us to come together and supersize a format that’s generated in a European market is something we really learnt from ‘The Traitors’ and will be applying to this,” Havard agreed. Scripted co-production has flowered in the last decade, though high-end U.S.-U.K. examples have dropped off in number in the last few years. “In unscripted, we are learning very quickly that partnerships just unlock so much ambition and potential,” Irtizaali argued. “The future of big unscripted shows of scale is going to come from some sort of international partnership,” Havard concurred. “We’re entering a golden age of unscripted. Shows which comes with huge ambition, huge distinction and huge scale – those are only possible through partnerships,” Irtizaali concluded."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> International -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Ahead of the December 19 release of Season 6, which culminates with the long-awaited Jack & Mel nuptials, Netflix has renewed the popular romantic drama for a seventh season. Like Season 6 (as well as Seasons 1-3), it will consist of 10 episodes. With the early renewal, Virgin River becomes Netflix’s longest-running current original scripted series as well as the longest-running English-language drama series in the streamer’s history. Its seven-season run to date matches that of comedy Grace and Frankie and comedy-drama Orange Is the New Black, which was designated as a comedy for its first couple of seasons before switching to drama consideration. Virgin River has now eclipsed such Netflix staples as House of Cards and The Crown, which ran for six seasons each, with only the Spanish teen drama Elite ahead of it in number of seasons (eight) but not episodes (64 vs 74 for Virgin River through seven seasons). The longevity of Virgin River is not surprising. An adaptation of Robyn Carr’s novels, the series has a sustainable premise, revolving around a group of characters living in a small town. It has an appealing cast, led by Alexandra Breckenridge (Mel) and Martin Henderson (Jack) and anchored by veterans Tim Matheson and Annette O’Toole. It has appealing economics, too. Watch on Deadline RELATED: 2024 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming At a time when streamers are looking to keep budgets under control, Virgin River has a very reasonable price tag — it films in Canada, the bulk of the action takes place inside a bar, a small clinic and a couple of houses, and there are virtually no stunts or special effects involved (save for a wildfire storyline last season). Meanwhile, Virgin River remains popular, with the first five seasons making Netflix’s Global Top 10 English series list 25 times since the list’s 2021 launch and Season 5 ranking in the Top 10 in 77 countries. Since the streamer makes its renewal decisions based on viewership vs. cost, it is clear why it keeps ordering more Virgin River. (An early renewal would make for a shorter gap between seasons, potentially keeping the romantic drama a holiday fixture after December releases for the Season 5 finale special and Season 6.) RELATED: Renewed TV Series 2024: A Photo Gallery Ahead of Season 5, Netflix Head of Drama Jinny Howe spoke of the “understanding that this is a really rich universe of characters and that people can’t seem to get enough, myself included,” adding that, “as long as that continues to be the case — which we’re very hopeful for — you can rest assured that there will be more Virgin River.“ Creating a Virgin River universe by expanding the world through offshoots has been a priority for Netflix. The streamer is taking a first crack at that in Season 6, which introduces Mel’s parents and their 1970s love story with the idea of potentially spinning that off into a prequel series. During its run so far, Virgin River underwent a slight creative shift with a showrunner change after Season 4. Patrick Sean Smith, who took the helm from series developer Sue Tenney, will return as showrunner and executive producer in Season 7. Also returning as executive producers are Tenney, Amy Palmer Robertson, Roma Roth, Christopher E. Perry, Carr, Erin Cardillo and Richard Keith, joined by new EP Jennifer Monroe. Co-executive producers include Ian Hay, Thomas Ian Griffith, Mary Page Keller and Jackson Sinder. Virgin River started with nurse practitioner Melinda “Mel” Monroe’s moving to the remote California town of Virgin River looking for a fresh start. There, she found a community — and love with local bar owner Jack Sheridan. Season 6 is set against the backdrop of Mel and Jack’s romantic spring wedding season, chronicling the preparations — and the big day — alongside new twists, fresh drama and more love triangles. In addition to Breckenridge, Henderson, Matheson and O’Toole, Season 6 series regulars include Colin Lawrence, Benjamin Hollingsworth, Zibby Allen, Sarah Dugdale, Marco Grazzini, Kai Bradbury, Kandyse McClure and Mark Ghanime.

Last year, Disney accelerated negotiations to buy the Comcast/NBCU stake in Hulu to take full ownership of the streaming service. In December 2023, the Mouse House paid $8.61 billion to Comcast, which represented one-third of the $27.5 billion guaranteed floor value for Hulu that was set when the companies entered into their agreement in 2019. But so far, the two sides have been unable to agree on a fair market value for Hulu. Popular on Variety During the initial phase of the appraisal process, Disney’s third-party appraiser arrived at a valuation that fell below the $27.5 billion guaranteed floor value — while NBCU’s appraiser arrived at a valuation “substantially in excess of the guaranteed floor value,” according to Disney’s 10-Q filed with the SEC Wednesday for its third quarter of fiscal 2024. In May 2024, Disney and NBCU entered into a “confidential arbitration” to resolve the dispute over the appraisal process to determine the fair value of Hulu “in which the parties seek declaratory relief, equitable relief and unspecified damages,” Disney disclosed. Per the companies’ agreement, if the two sides’ valuations were not within 10% of each other, the banks they enlisted for the transaction would pick a third firm to make another estimate, and Hulu’s final valuation will be the average of the two figures that are closest to each other. According to the Disney filing, if NBCU’s appraisal were “deemed to be valid” and a third appraiser’s equity fair-value determination “were consistent with the NBCU’s appraiser’s valuation,” Disney would be required to pay NBCU an additional amount of approximately $5 billion as its share of the difference between the equity fair value and the guaranteed floor value. That suggests that Comcast’s third-party appraisal valued Hulu in the neighborhood of $40.8 billion. If the third appraiser’s equity fair value determination for Hulu were between the valuations of Disney’s and NBCU’s appraisers, the incremental amount Disney would have to pay would be “between zero and approximately $5 billion.” The outcome of the Hulu deal arbitration “is uncertain and we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of the arbitration on the appraisal process, and thus any impact on the determination of Hulu’s equity fair value and any additional amount we may be required to pay to acquire NBCU’s interest in Hulu,” Disney noted in the filing. The two sides have been far apart on the question of Hulu’s market value for months.

Created by Harjo, the drama is a Tulsa noir about a guy (Hawke) who knows too much. The pilot cast includes Keith David, Siena East, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Tim Blake Nelson, Scott Shepherd, Tracy Letts , Kyle Maclachlan and Macon Blair. We spoke to Harjo on the red carpet at the Emmy’s (video above), where he shared his excitement over his new collaboration with Hawke. “There’s a pilot I made this year called The Sensitive Kind starring Ethan Hawke—I think it’s coming,” he shared. When I asked him if that meant it was picked up, Harjo flashed a nervous smile and said, “I kinda can’t say but...it’s coming and it’s going to be awesome.” Harjo also serves as writer and director on the pilot, which he and Hawke executive produce with Garrett Basch. The project falls under Harjo’s overall deal with FX Productions, which is the project’s studio. The order for the series comes on the heels of Reservation Dogs ending its award-winning three-season run on FX as the network’s topper John Landgraf told Deadline this week that he and his team are focused on finding worthy successors to Reservation Dogs and the handful of other successful series that wrapped in the past year.

With the layoffs, the company expects to record a $300 million-$400 million restructuring charge in Q3, Paramount CFO Naveen Chopra said. The details were announced on Paramount’s Q2 earnings call, after the company announced a massive operating loss on a $5.98 billion write-down on the value of its cable TV networks. The devaluation of Paramount’s cable biz was tied to its agreement to be acquired by Skydance Media, which is expected to close by Sept. 30, 2025. Speaking on the call, Chris McCarthy, who heads Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks, said the job cuts will be primarily in marketing and communications departments at the company with some “right-sizing” in other areas including legal, finance and other corporate functions. McCarthy said Paramount expects to complete the layoffs by the end of 2024. Popular on Variety Paramount Global had 21,900 employees worldwide as of the end of 2023. In February, the company eliminated about 800 positions. Currently, the company is led by three execs in the “Office of the CEO”: McCarthy, CBS boss George Cheeks and Brian Robbins, president/CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon. The three co-CEOs previously announced plans to cut $500 million in annualized costs, including through layoffs, before the Skydance pact was clinched with controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and Paramount’s board. The management trio had already begun to eliminate duplicative job functions, including across corporate functions like legal and corporate marketing, Variety reported. The cost-cutting targets of the Skydance team have been even more aggressive. Jeff Shell, set to become president of the combined company, has said Skydance, working with consulting firm Bain & Co., is aiming to achieve at least $2 billion in annualized cost synergies at Paramount. On the earnings call, Paramount’s Chopra emphasized that the $500 million in yearly cost-cuts scoped out by the co-CEOs is incorporated into that $2 billion number. Shell, chairman of RedBird Sports & Media and former CEO of NBCUniversal, said last month during a press briefing that much of those cost cuts will come from Paramount’s linear TV business: “We know that linear is challenged and declining...

Touting Netflix’s next viewer report, due on Thursday, Sarandos said on Wednesday at the Fast Company Innovation Festival in New York City that “I don’t think we could be any more transparent than that,” and he added, “I’m hoping that the other folks in the business will follow suit on that.” Sarandos intimated that Netflix would look very good in a side-by-side comparison, because people will be able to see a “phenomenal” amount of daily Netflix viewership happening across the globe. He said the viewership report will also demonstrate that “the biggest movies of the year are these movies that are made for Netflix and only playing on Netflix.” Thursday’s report will show 94 billion hours total of viewing in the first half of 2024, Sarandos said. “That’s a lot of time.” Watch on Deadline The top 4 are British-produced television shows, Sarandos said. Fresh off a keynote address at RTS London, Sarandos arrived at the Fast Company festival with his company’s subscriber base and stock price at or near all-time highs following the introduction of a discounted ad-tier option for viewers. On Monday, the influential Financial Times of London declared Sarandos the victor in the streaming wars over the likes of Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount, Amazon and Comcast. A potential black eye looms in the $170 million defamation suit filed by Fiona Harvey, the real-life “Martha” depicted in Netflix’s multiple Emmy winner Baby Reindeer. Sarandos at RTS defended the show and its creator as “not a documentary” and as “Richard Gadd’s true story,” one in which it’s “abundantly clear that there is dramatization involved.” Sarandos also made clear that scripted programming remains at the heart of Netflix’s content strategy, and to that end has sought to calm fears about AI’s capacity to wipe out industry jobs. “If you look back over a hundred years of entertainment, you can see how great technology and great entertainment work hand in hand,” he said on an earnings call in July. “Animation didn’t get cheaper, it got better in the move from hand-drawn to CGI animation. And more people work in animation today than ever in history. “So I’m pretty sure that there’s a better business and a bigger business in making content 10% better than it is making it 50% cheaper,” he added. Sarandos also has said that Netflix never will be a breaking-news provider. As the company eases into live sports broadcasting, an area of aggressive expansion for rival streamers including Amazon, Sarandos has struck a note of caution about Netflix’s possible future as a sports outlet. He’s all in, though, on the company’s acquisition of Monday Night Raw and other WWE pro-wrestling fare in a “drama of sport” category, as he’s called it, that fits with Netflix’s storytelling ethos and its growing library of sports documentaries. Sarandos, questioned about transparency by Fast Company Editor-in-Chief Brendan Vaughan, said that Netflix’s decision to stop reporting subscriber counts beginning in 2025 is “a Wall Street thing.” “For the longest time, our subscribers and our financial metrics all were aligned,” he said, adding, “We only had one tier of service and basically one price point. ... Today we have multiple price points, multiple price points by region. We have an ad tier that we’ve introduced recently. So Netflix starts at $6.99 and all of these subs have different economics to them, so they don’t tie as cleanly to revenue and profit growth as they used to.” A “disconnect” between subscriber numbers and finances “led us to try to get to a cleaner view where we’ll talk mostly about revenue and profit,” Sarandos said, “and then we’ll announce subscribers at different milestones in the business.” Netflix has 280 million subscribers globally, Sarandos said. In the wide-ranging 35-minute talk, Sarandos also reflected on Netflix’s complicated rivalry with YouTube. “If you look at revenue, engagement and profit, our businesses are very, very similar, almost identical,” he said of YouTube. “But that’s kind of where the comparisons end. It is a very different business model, and we’re barely advertising. They’re all advertising. Where they’re mostly user-generated, we’re now no-user-generated.” And while Netflix trailers are a YouTube staple, “when fans love a show, they want to go on YouTube and talk about it,” Sarandos said. He added that Netflix garners “forty times” more trailer views on its own site than it does on YouTube. He called both platforms “pretty similar in terms of the ability to reach and generate excitement,” but wondered whether YouTube would fare as well with the obligations that Netflix has, such as assuring safety on production sets and abiding by union regulations. “I don’t know how brittle that business model becomes if you introduce content costs and any form of regulation on YouTube,” he said. Looking back on Netflix’s progress, Sarandos said that from his early days working for company founder Reed Hastings, the goal was “to put the right show in front of the right people at the right time.” At first, he recalled, it was “100 people in a warehouse stuffing envelopes,” a reference to the company’s pioneering DVD-by-mail subscription operation. Netflix has spent 25 years, in effect, trying to build an “audience matching algorithm,” Sarandos said, explaining that “the problem we were trying to really solve was personalized marketing.” One of the company’s next goals is to increase its share of everyone’s viewing time, Sarandos said. “We’re only about 10 percent of screen time” in the U.S., the company’s “most penetrated” market, he said — a figure he called “hard to imagine,” but one that leaves room to grow. Original films and television series will be a part of that growth, he predicted, as will Netflix’s move into live events such as sports and sports-adjacent programming. “Our first one that really broke through is the Tom Brady roast,” he said. He also pointed to a pair of NFL games to be streamed live on Christmas Day. “I think we can continue along this path, which is about a $600 billion market that we’re only about five percent of today,” Sarandos said. “So it’s not that big of a stretch to think that we can get to twice that.” Even if Netflix doubles, reaching 560 million subscribers globally, he said, “that would still be very short of the household penetration of pay television in its heyday, but with a much better economic model and, I would argue, a much better product because it gives choice and selection and variety and control to the consumer.” Asked about last year’s writer and actor strikes, Sarandos said they were in part a response to people being “generally fearful of the new model.” “Until they get to know it and get to understand it better,” he said, “I can understand why they would be.” Sarandos said that Netflix and the creative people who work in film and television remain “mutually dependent.” “We need great storytellers,” he said. “My goal is they all get rich and famous, and we can try to provide them the opportunity for that to happen. And if they do their job really, really well, they will. There’s a romanticism of clinging to things that used to be, always. So I think we see that with the movie model, which was not — the returns on the movie model overall were never that great. Single-digit-return businesses over any given decade. “The problem is that the physical distribution costs, and the marketing costs to get there, it creates a lot of inefficiencies that don’t go to the talent and they really don’t end up on screen,” Sarandos continued. “And what we’re trying to do is take all those things and put it on the screen so that we do compensate people. “It’s in a different model,” he said, “but at the end of the day I think it’s a greater model than it was before, which is, risk is shipped to us, so that we pay for the production of the film, we buy the talent, and we actually kind of pre-negotiate what we think of how it will perform, and pay as if it did.” Sarandos said the detailed biannual viewer reports for thousands of Netflix titles are one way of reassuring the film and television community. “Put the number out there so that talent can see it, so that agents can see it, so that the press can see it, and know what’s a hit and what’s a miss.” He said that not everything on Netflix is a “home run,” using a baseball analogy to say that Netflix thrives by also hitting singles, doubles and triples. Asked about predicting hits before they air, he said, “This creative process is incredibly human, so you’re going to have hits, hot and cold streaks. And the beauty of it is when you’ve got the …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strategy & Miscellaneous News -> General News & Strategy -> Misc. News"}]}

The number of those let go is around 175, or 14% of the staff. The pullback is largely due to Disney+ scaling back on direct-to-consumer series. Bob Iger has signaled the need for a more disciplined approach to streaming since returning as CEO in November 2022. Since Covid, Pixar has yet to produce a bona-fide all-quadrants hit, though the animation division has also been hampered by distribution moves that sent three consecutive releases straight to streaming. Heading into summer, all eyes are on Inside Out 2, which openis over Fathers Day weekend, June 14 to 16. Director Kelsey Mann’s sequel is among a group of big movies expected to work this summer, raking in hundreds of millions of dollars. PREVIOUS, JAN. 12: Pixar Animation Studios is planning to reduce its workforce in the coming months, an insider confirmed to Deadline, as part of overall content spending trims at Disney. Watch on Deadline An initial report on the planned staff cuts by TechCrunch indicated it could affect up to 20% of the overall workforce, but the source pushed back on that estimate. No specifics or timeline for the reduction have yet been determined. The pullback is related to an easing of the studio’s production workflow, which went into overdrive under former CEO Bob Chapek. The ex-boss not only put three straight Pixar films onto Disney+ without a theatrical release, but he also ordered episodic series, which the animation studio had never previously done. Franchise films haven’t always gone smoothly (for every Toy Story 4, there has been a Lightyear or Cars 2) but episodic fare is a whole new realm. While Pixar has historically been structured differently than other animation houses, with fewer project-based workers coming on, the drive to produce streaming series worthy of the Pixar name has boosted the workforce to around 1,300. Pixar’s first original series, Win or Lose, is slated to premiere on Disney+ later this year. The company’s feature film output is continuing, with Inside Out 2 on deck for summer, though it’s been a tougher go for the company’s slate in recent years. Elemental, which premiered last June, opened softly but racked up a cumulative gross of almost $500 million worldwide. Given the hefty budgets at Pixar, whose films take years to produce and often have budgets north of $200 million, the release model is undergoing a re-evaluation. Staffing is a component of that, the Pixar source told Deadline. Disney declined to comment. Bob Iger, who took over for Chapek in November 2022, has presided over extensive cost-cutting. In three rounds of layoffs in 2023, thousands of staffers exited, including the first in many years at Pixar, and cost savings totaled $7.5 billion. Total content spending in fiscal 2024 is projected to be $25 billion, down from $27 billion in the prior year. Disney has been under pressure from investors to boost its lagging stock price. While linear TV challenges and the uncertain economics of streaming have certainly weighed on shares, the surprisingly spotty performance of the film studio, including mainstays like Marvel and Pixar, has also been a drag."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Org -> Org"}]}

Speaking on Thursday at the Bloomberg Screentime conference, Bajaria pointed to recent stories about Netflix’s plans to unveil a new compensation structure “total fabrications.” “We like our model, and we like our model in film and TV,” Bajaria said. “On the film side, even, which a lot has been written about, we are not changing our model. Our model works great for talent. It works great for filmmakers. It’s worked well for us. We like the model. It’s worked for a long time. So we are not changing our compensation model.” Bajaria said there have been “a few bespoke deals” with talent on a handful of films in which talent “was interested in the opportunity of, we’ll take some risk, we’re going to share more upside, and they were interested in that.” Popular on Variety But Bajaria said that’s only happened twice. “It’s a very tiny thing that has blown up to this story of we’re changing our business. We’re not,” she said. “On TV, we have not done one of those deals. So that’s just not true.” When it was pointed out that Netflix has previously said it wouldn’t change its model and then did (including getting into the advertising business), Bajaria did admit that Netflix has changed as the business evolves. “We understand the business and we change,” she said. “We’re willing to pivot and grow and evolve and innovate, instead of saying, ‘This has always the way it’s been done, and we can never change it.... The business has changed. So we’re gonna we’re gonna change. Maybe that’s the reason everybody wants to write stories that are not accurate. I just think there’s no story there.” Bajaria was referring to reports in other publications that a recent Netflix meeting with top talent representatives would unveil some sort of new structure. In reality, it was a “Netflix 101” gathering to point out to reps where the streamer stands as a pure play business only making film, TV and games. It was a “‘here’s a peek behind the curtain,'” she said. “‘We’re partners with you, and we want to make sure that we share this information and kind of set the table of what we’re trying to do, and our aspiration to make amazing film and TV all around the world.'” Asked about Netflix’s committment to movies, particularly as it shifts more dollars to live events like the NFL, Bajaria said that she believed “looking at like cost in that way is sort of the wrong way to look at the business. I really look at it as, we know people love movies, and so we should make lots of movies... We’re a subscription business, and our members love movies, and our members want to watch great movies at home in their living rooms.” There’s also the issue of Netflix viewing being flat the first half of the year according to its most recent data release. Bajaria attributed that to having a lighter output on the service following the Hollywood strikes. “That sort of impacted some of the stuff we had on in the US, especially,” she said. But Bajaria said she expected that trend to change in the second half of the year, thanks to its huge hits in the recent returns of “Bridgerton” and “Emily in Paris,” as wekk as “Perfect Couple,” “Monsters: The Lyle and Eric Menendez Story” and “Nobody Wants This.” And then next up is the long-awaited Season 2 of “Squid Game.” “Director Hwang is an amazing writer/director, and it’s such an interesting way that he can talk about class and money,” she said. “It has that great iconography and amazing, surprising games, new games that you’ve not seen before. There’s just such great character storytelling in there, and he has great surprises, just like the first season. It totally delivers on what people would hope that it would be.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Highlights From The Quarter -> General News & Strategy"}]}

It was one of Hollywood’s few successes in 2023 in China, where it earned $65 million. The Denis Villeneuve-directed “Dune” released in China in October 2021 and earned a more modest $38 million. Rereleases and extensions of theatrical runs beyond a standard four weeks for Hollywood imports are relatively rare (but not unheard of) in China. And both require approval from film authorities. In the case of “Oppenheimer,” the rerelease appears intended to capitalize on growing interest ahead of the Oscars ceremony on March 10. But the Christopher Nolan-directed title will have to compete for premium large screens with “Dune,” which will rerelease the same day on March 1. “Dune,” which is believed to have a fan-base in China, but released in the middle of the COVID era, could likely have done better. The film’s rerelease will neatly cue up the March 8 release of “Dune 2” and allow uninitiated viewers to catch up on the back story. At least two other Hollywood titles have also already been given runway to succeed in China. Dreamworks Animation/ Universal’s Chinese-themed “Kung Fu Panda 4” will release on March 22, two weeks after the beginning of its international rollout. That will be followed a week later by “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” on March 29, the same weekend as North America and the bulk of its international outings. While there is unusual forward visibility into the Hollywood releasing schedule in China over the next couple of months, it is also clear that the U.S. titles must take their turn behind the locally-produced tentpoles and franchise pictures that will release this coming weekend in time for Chinese New Year. The week-long holiday (this year it officially runs Feb. 10-17, but employers are encouraged to give workers time off on Friday, Feb. 9 as well) has become the biggest cinema-going season of the year in China. Last year, gross revenues clocked in only fractionally shy of $1 billion. This time, at least eight significant titles will be competing in the mostly family entertainment space. They include: “Pegasus 2” a car-racing comedy sequel; “Yolo,” the latest film by “Hi, Mom” star and director Jia Ling; and “Article 20,” this year’s offering by the evergreen Zhang Yimou. In several cases, the U.S. pictures’ Chinese connections may be a helpful factor. Legendary East, a China subsidiary of Legendary Entertainment — the Hollywood studio that remains partly-controlled by China’s Wanda Culture despite the financial woes of Wanda owner Wang Jianlin — is the entity credited as presenter of “Dune,” “Dune 2” and “Godzilla x Kong.” In overseas territories, Warner Bros. is the distributor of record. And while “Kung Fu Panda 4” does not have the East-West co-venture status that 2016’s “Kung Fu Panda 3” enjoyed – China Film Group and the since dissolved Oriental Dreamworks were credited as producers – it is understood that state-owned China Film retains a “supervised by” credit on the new picture."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Film -> General News & Strategy"}]}

U.S. District Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett on Wednesday pushed back on arguments from Disney lawyer Daniel Petrocelli, who argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed because the company has the “right not to associate with a high-profile performer on a high-profile show who’s imbuing” the Star Wars series with “views it disagrees with” that could turn fans away from the show. Related Stories Petrocelli urged the court to find in favor of Disney on its First Amendment defense on dismissal rather than at a later stage of litigation after discovery takes place in which it’s determined whether the case should be allowed to proceed to trial. “I’m not convinced there are no disputed facts,” Judge Garnett responded. She pointed to allegations that Carano was terminated to deflect attention from Disney’s contentious business decisions at the time, including the company’s contract dispute with Scarlett Johansson and criticism of Florida’s Parental Rights in Education law, which led to the dissolution of its special tax district in the state. The lawsuit revolves around allegations from Carano that she was wrongfully terminated and discriminated against when she was booted from the series for voicing right-wing opinions on social media. The former MMA fighter appeared on the first two seasons of The Mandalorian. She wasn’t under contract to appear on the third season or any other Disney production, according to court filings. Carano sued after Lucasfilm in 2021 announced that she wouldn’t be returning to the series after sharing a post in which she said, “most people today don’t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews.” The post continued, “How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?” She advanced claims that Disney violated California labor laws prohibiting employers from directing workers’ political activity and reprimanding employees on the basis of political speech. At Wednesday’s hearing, Gene Schaerr, a lawyer for the actress, stressed that the comments at issue in the case were made from Carano’s personal social media accounts. “Nothing she said was on the show or on set,” he said as Carano sat at the defense table in the courtroom. That may not matter, at least according to Disney. The company claimed that there are broad liberties afforded to private speakers and what viewpoints they choose — and don’t choose — to express. In a case dealing with free speech rights, the Supreme Court held that organizers of a parade had a constitutional right not to include in the event a group seeking to express a message that they didn’t want to convey. The organizers’ decision to “exclude a message it did not like” fell within its “right as a private speaker to shape its expression by speaking on one subject by remaining silent,” the court found. Disney argued there’s a First Amendment right to choose employees who properly convey their values, even when those choices would otherwise violate state anti-discrimination laws. It cited the Supreme Court, in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, finding that the organization’s decision to fire an openly gay assistant scoutmaster is protected under the constitution. That constitutional right, the court concluded, shields the scouts from violations of New Jersey discrimination laws. Under those two cases, Disney said that the state can’t force employers engaged in “expressive activity,” — in Disney’s case movies and TV shows — to convey its message through speakers like Carano who allegedly impair its ability to properly express its values, which it said include respect, integrity and inclusion. The First Amendment, it claimed, entitles it to protect its speech in the Star Wars series from association with views that it and many viewers considered offensive and contrary to its message. “The messenger is part of the message,” Petrocelli said. He posited, “Imagine she made comments that she hates Jews or that there was no Holocaust.” In response to Disney’s focus on the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dale, Schaerr said that free speech rights can’t be used as a shield against violations of discrimination laws and that the ruling in the case was based on a fully developed factual record, not at the motion to dismiss stage. He underscored, “Disney’s First Amendment defense cannot allow it to shortcircuit the normal litigation process.” Discovery will reveal whether the company violated state civil rights laws when it terminated Carano, he added. “I don’t necessarily disagree with you,” Garnett replied. Carano’s backers include Elon Musk, who’s helping fund the lawsuit through X. He said he would foot the legal bill for users who claim they have been discriminated against due to their activity on the platform.

His legacy will be measured as much by what he didn’t do during his time as the top as it will by the initiatives he took to restructure and reimagine the company for its second century. The seasoned executive, who orchestrated a much-needed turnaround of the studio, has been selected as this year’s recipient of the Variety Vanguard Award recognizing individuals who have made a significant contribution to the global business of television. The kudo will be presented to Vinciquerra on Oct. 21 at the Mipcom global content market and conference in Cannes. In shoring up one of Hollywood’s foundational studios, Vinciquerra restored the health of a key industry employer. For steering the ship through tough industry headwinds, the onset of the streaming wars, the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2023 writers and actors strikes, Sony Group Corp. chairman-CEO Kenichiro Yoshida hailed the studio chief for his “deep experience and expertise in the entertainment space, his strategic vision and his outstanding leadership.” Popular on Variety Vinciquerra will hand the CEO reins to his hand-picked successor, Ravi Ahuja, who is currently SPE’s president and chief operating officer. Vinciquerra will remain with SPE as non-executive chairman through December 2025. “He’s got the experience that we need in the person that is going to run the company. And he’s very calm, very level-headed, very smart,” Vinciquerra says of Ahuja’s promotion. Under Vinciquerra’s leadership, SPE was deliberate in its positioning at a moment of massive transition for the pay TV sector. Sony did not join its larger rival studios in rushing to build direct-to-consumer streaming platforms. The one money-losing streamer that SPE had under its roof when Vinciquerra arrived in mid-2017 — Crackle — was sold off less than two years later. “Early on, we decided not to go into the general entertainment streaming business. All of these companies had jumped in feet first and really didn’t have a plan, except that they were going to be desperate for subscribers. And instead of us diving in to do the same thing, we made the decision to be the arms dealer, and we bulked up on our bench of [TV] creators and did very, very well with it,” Vinciquerra tells Variety. Instead, SPE embraced Sony Corp’s strength with anime production through its Japan-based Aniplex banner to assemble a subscription anime streamer that taps into the rabid fandom for the serial animation format. Today, SPE’s Crunchyroll streamer boasts more than 15 million subscribers, and it delivers a profit. “We could see that [anime fans] were growing and it was relatively inexpensive product. We weren’t spending $5 million an episode. We’re spending $200,000 to $400,000 an episode. So we jumped in with both feet, and now we’re in a good place with Crunchyroll,” Vinciquerra says. “We’re still searching for the next very specific, genre-based streaming service. We think there’s more to do there.” Vinciquerra’s reinvention campaign also included getting a grip on SPE’s more than 20 in-house production banners, which were spread far and wide in Europe, Latin America and Asia to a degree that didn’t make financial sense for the studio. “We decided to focus on the places where we thought we could really win,” Vinciquerra says. Chief among them is the U.K., where international TV production chief Wayne Garvie has steered SPE to scoop up prosperous production outfits, including Jane Tranter’s Bad Wolf (“His Dark Materials”), Eleven (“Sex Education”) and Eleventh Hour Films (“Alex Riter”). Vinciquerra’s first 18 months at the studio was marked by a whirlwind of restructurings, layoffs and management changes. He also sold or shuttered dozens of international cable channels that were a drag on earnings. He had strong convictions about what needed to be done, drawing from his experience that includes 10 years of running Fox Networks Group and six years as a media advisor to private equity giant TPG. “I was on the board of Pandora, I was on the board of DirecTV, I was on the board of Qualcomm and a bunch of other companies. So I saw very clearly what was happening in our business from the outside,” Vinciquerra recalls. “When I got here, the company was in rough shape.” He had strong feelings about what needed to change but he did second-guess himself occasionally during the go-go years leading up to the shock of the pandemic. “I questioned myself — am I right not getting in the streaming service business? Because everybody told me how stupid I was for not doing it and getting rid of the cable networks. People here questioned that a lot,” he recalls. Vinciquerra stuck with his instincts to streamline SPE operations. The need to rehabilitate struggling assets has been a constant in his career, ever since he got his first job in radio sales in Albany, N.Y. Years later, he learned an important lesson when he he took over as general manager of Westinghouse Broadcasting’s WBZ-TV Boston. It was just about the time the parent company slashed costs and took the station’s head count to 200 employees, down from 350. “You have to have a critical mass of employees to understand what the problem is, how to solve the problem and what to do to get to the place you want it to be,” he says. “Once you get a critical mass of people believing in it, the naysayersgo underground.” Vinciquerra stayed in broadcasting, working as a senior leader for CBS Television Stations and for Hearst in the 1990s when that company went on a station-buying spree. He credits Peter Chernin, the respected media investor and former head of 20th Century Fox and president of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., for bringing him into the showbiz big leagues. Chernin pushed Vinciquerra to segue into overseeing the Fox broadcast network as well as its cable properties. It was a goal that really paid off — especially as Vinciquerra remembers trying to talk Chernin out of giving him the job at first. Years later, he’s grateful that Chernin didn’t listen to him. “Logically, it didn’t make any sense to hire me to run the Fox broadcast network because I’d never had any network experience,” Vinciquerra recalls. I ran TV stations. It’s a very different business.” Among his accomplishments at Sony, Vinciquerra cites overcoming two very different challenges. When he took the role in 2017, Vinciquerra told the corporate leaders that the studio was missing opportunities by not working more closely with talent and content franchises owned by Sony Corp.’s PlayStation gaming division and in the Sony Music division. The Sony leadership in Tokyo was supportive. But from his experience at Fox, he also knew such collaborations could not be dictated from above. “It doesn’t work if you say, ‘You do this.’ You have to get the [creative] groups to work together and get their creative juices flowing,” he says. Sony convened about 40 key creative executives from gaming and pictures, put them in a large conference room and supplied them with a whiteboard. The directive to both teams from Tokyo was to find ways to work together “without worry too much about who’s going to pay for what,” Vinciquerra recalls. “They spent two days together and they came up with 12 or 14 different projects to work on together. We’ve done seven or eight now,” he says. The list includes HBO’s acclaimed drama series adaptation “The Last of Us,” which is heading to its strike-delayed sophomore season, 2022’s “Uncharted” and 2023’s “Gran Turismo” and “Twisted Metal.” On the music side, Bruce Springsteen is working on an unscripted project with Sony’s TV division. Bad Bunny, the top-selling reggaeton star, had a small role in 2022’s Brad Pitt starrer “Bullet Train,” and he will again appear in an upcoming Sony film. Another notable milestone during his tenure was the extensive renovation and refurbishment of SPE’s massive lot in Culver City, which was once the hallowed ground of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Some of the studio’s soundstages hadn’t been maintained well for decades. Wood planks between the walls were buckling, creating a fire hazard among other problems, not to mention the other aging infrastructure inside. A strong earthquake might have easily knocked one or more down. Early on in his run, Vinciquerra’s team hammered out a five-year plan for making infrastructure upgrades and improvements. And then COVID happened. With the lot empty of staff and production activity for months, most of the heavy-duty construction work was completed in 18 months. “We ended up redoing virtually every wall and every stage through the rest of the pandemic,” he says. “Even now, we’re not quite done.” The Culver City lot is such a …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Highlights From The Quarter -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Asked by Deadline last month whether they had approached the Season 6 closer as a season or series finale amid uncertainty over The Conners‘ future, Helford said, “We’ve got a final episode that may be one or the other.

The Amazon Prime Video movie has been slammed by none other than its director, Doug Liman, who is boycotting the film’s release due to Amazon’s decision not to open the movie in theaters. The new “Road House” launches on streaming via Prime Video in March. The film is premiering at SXSW, but Liman has said he will not be in attendance. In a new interview with Total Film magazine, however, Gyllenhaal seemingly confirmed Variety’s report about “Road House” always being intended for a global streaming release. Sources familiar with the negotiations told Variety that Liman, Gyllenhaal and producer Joel Silver were given a choice: Make the film for $60 million and get a theatrical release or take $85 million and go streaming only. They opted for the latter. Popular on Variety “They all took the money,” one knowledgeable source said. “I adore Doug’s tenacity, and I think he is advocating for filmmakers, and film in the cinema, and theatrical releases. But, I mean, Amazon was always clear that it was streaming,” Gyllenhaal now told Total Film. “I just want as many people to see it as possible. And I think we’re living in a world that’s changing in how we see and watch movies, and how they’re made. What’s clear to me, and what I loved so much, was [Liman’s] deep love for this movie, and his pride at how much he cares for it, how good he feels it is, and how much people should see it.” While Gyllenhaal enjoys watching movies on the big screen, he added that streaming releases can still be a platform for movies that entertain and/or move audiences emotionally. “I’ve also sat watching a film on my computer, or in different places, and been so profoundly moved. If the job of a story is to move people, I have been moved in both forms,” Gyllenhaal said. “I’m a deep lover of cinema and the theatrical release – but I also do really embrace the streaming world.” Variety reported that even after the “Road House” team took the streaming deal, producer Silver “continued to push for a theatrical release and grew so combative that the studio threatened to cut ties with him.” Liman came out swinging against Amazon Prime Video in a first person essay on Deadline in which he said he’d be boycotting the “Road House” premiere at SXSW because of the decision not to release his movie in theaters. “Amazon has no interest in supporting cinemas,” Liman wrote. “Amazon will exclusively stream ‘Road House’ on Amazon’s Prime. Amazon asked me and the film community to trust them and their public statements about supporting cinemas, and then they turned around and are using Road House to sell plumbing fixtures.” “That hurts the filmmakers and stars of ‘Road House’ who don’t share in the upside of a hit movie on a streaming platform,” he continued. “And they deprive Jake Gyllenhaal — who gives a career-best performance — the opportunity to be recognized come award season. But the impact goes far beyond this one movie. This could be industry shaping for decades to come.” “Road House” streams March 21 on Prime Video."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Film -> General News & Strategy"}]}

The project, going under the working title of Romantics Anonymous, will feature talent from Japan and Korea — two of the core countries at the center of Netflix’s strategy in Asia. Shun Oguri (Godzilla vs. Kong), Han Hyo-Joo (Moving), Yuri Nakamura and Jin Akanishi have been cast in the series, with Sho Tsukikawa (Yu Yu Hakusho), who’s also known for numerous romantic films, attached to direct. Yong Film — the Korean producer behind the likes of Believer 2, The Call, 20th Century Girl and My Name is Loh Kiwan — has developed the project as its first Japanese series. Watch on Deadline Lee Ha Jun (Parasite) will lead the production design, including the central chocolate boutique set. Yang Jin Mo (Parasite) will serve as editor, and Dalpalan will work on the music. Production has begun ahead of a 2025 debut, with Yong Film’s Lim Seung Young the showrunner. The story begins with a chance encounter between a man and a woman sparked by their mutual love for chocolate. However, both live with their own anxiety disorders: the man can’t physically touch others, while the woman can’t make eye contact. Oguri plays Sosuke Fujiwara, the son of a major confectionery magnate whose germophobia complicates his new job at popular chocolate shop Le Sauveur. Han plays gifted chocolatier Hana Lee, who conceals her identity from the Le Sauveur members, except for the owner, and battles her own fears of social interactions. Nakamura plays a renowned psychologist and author who not only serves as Sosuke’s physician but also becomes a counselor to Hana, despite her own struggles with alcoholism and romance. Akanishi portrays Sosuke’s long-term friend, for whom Hana secretly harbors feelings. “When I received the offer, the plot was tightly crafted and the project’s vision was clear,” said Shun. “An amazing cast and crew quickly came together, and I was very excited to start. Currently, we’re diligently examining the nuances and differences between the Japanese and Korean languages and do our best to make this work better. I look forward to continuing this enjoyable project with this wonderful team and deliver excitement and thrills to everyone.” Han also pointed to the Asian collaboration, noting she was “especially delighted to be acting alongside our Korean team of producers, and the art, editing and music directors in this collaboration between Korea and Japan.” “While we’ve faced some challenges due to the collaborative nature of this project, I’m truly enjoying working with the director, my co-actors and our staff. I’ve made many unforgettable memories,” she added. Tsukikawa said: “We are searching for the best approach as we film. It’s an exhilarating process, and we’re committed to combining all our efforts to deliver something exceptional.” Showrunner Young added the project had been in development for the years, “through the hands of a Korean screenwriter, a Japanese director, and the performance of top actors from both Japan and Korea.” Data dump findings The news comes after Netflix’s second viewing data dump highlighted the continued global interest in Japanese and Korean content. Deadline analysis shows programs from the two countries making up 24% of the Top 100 most viewed TV shows globally by hours viewed. Released last week, the What We Watched report for the July-December 2023 period shows total hours of Korean TV viewing hit 3.24 billion hours viewed, down 12% on the massive 3.71 billion viewed in the previous six months. It should be noted many Korean shows have longer run times than those from the U.S. or Europe — and this is partially reflected in Netflix’s new ‘Views’ metric. The numbers are still very sizeable, far outstripping most other countries’ content. Topping the Top 100 by hours viewed was limited series King the Land, which took 630.2 million (and 33.2 million views). The next largest Korean title was Destined with You (222 million and 12.8 million views) followed by Strong Girl Nam-soon (195.7 million and 11.5 million views). Squid Game, the survival drama that created the appetite for K-drama on Netflix, charted in the 60s with 117.1 million total hours and 14.1 million despite launching three years ago. Overall, Korean shows accounted for 20 of the top 100 shows by total hours. Netflix’s top brass famously pledged in April 2023 to spend $2.5B in the country over the following four years, and the latest numbers highlight why they’ve taken that position. Squid Game season 2 due to launch later this year, which is arguably the service’s biggest new title of this year. Japanese titles clocked it at just under 800 million total hours viewed, including Yu Yu Hakusho season 1, Baki Hanma season 2 and My Happy Marriage season 1. Also included is season 1 of U.S.-Japan anime One Piece, which also accrued 71.6 million views — the most of any show on the Top 100 TV list. Chinese original Hidden Love also made the top 100 TV shows by total hours, clocking it at 115.7 million and 6.1 million views. A few notes of the latest data dump. As well as adding in the ‘views’ metric — which is used for Netflix’s Top 10 charts — the streamer also chose to split its TV and film catalogs into two this time round, making comparisons more complicated. However, this still covered around 99% of Netflix’s library when combined and could be broken down into comparable categories, allowing onlookers to form a better picture of performance on the streamer. According to the latest report, audiences watched 90 billion hours of Netflix content overall, on par with the first half of the year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> International -> Development -> TV"}]}

Overall ad revenue rose 24% in 2023 compared with 2022, he noted, reaching $47 billion and the growth was “primarily driven by our sponsored ads.” Amazon has added Sponsored TV to the mix, giving advertisers a self-service option that will inject their messages into more than 30 streaming services, including Amazon’s Freevee and Twitch. Earlier this year, Jassy recalled, Amazon’s Prime Video started including ads on scripted shows and films. He pegged overall reach at 200 million monthly viewers across movies and shows, Amazon MGM originals and live sports including NFL Thursday Night Football. “Streaming TV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start,” he wrote. Unlike Disney and Netflix, which have upped subscription rates for those preferring not to see ads, Prime Video introduced ads as a standard feature across its service. Any Prime member looking to avoid video ads has to pay an extra three dollars a month. As delicate as that message is to sell through with customers, it is a lucrative initiative. One Bank of America analyst’s forecast this year predicted the introduction of ads could soon bring in $5 billion in new annual revenue. Watch on Deadline The letter was released as an SEC filing. In a separate filing, Amazon in its proxy statement said Jassy’s pay rose to $1.36 million in 2023 from $1.3 million in 2022.

Ratings have been strong all around, including for all nine Wolf Entertainment procedurals from Universal Television — the Law & Order and Chicago franchises at NBC and the FBI trio at CBS — as well CBS/UTV’s The Equalizer. The Chicagos and the Law & Orders all opened their new seasons up by double digits in both total viewers and adults 18-49 compared with their final four episodes last season. The premieres of FBIs and Equalizer ranked in the Top 13 most watched primetime programs the week of February 12, all up or on par with the most recent episodes last season. In an interview with Deadline, Universal Television president Erin Underhill spoke of the uncertainty — and anxiety — within the industry about how scripted series would perform after the strike-related delay and gave her assessment as to why the procedurals did so well in their returns. Watch on Deadline The Chicago and Law & Order series debuted their new seasons in mid-January, three months after the end of the WGA strike and two months after the end of the SAG-AFTRA stoppage. Underhill described the “mad dash” to get the shows on the air through the holiday season as writers rooms opened just a couple of days after the writers strike. She also addressed the frequent cast changes on Wolf series, the upcoming renewals of all 10 procedurals, and the prospects of NBC’s Quantum Leap which just wrapped its second season heavily on the bubble. Universal TV has one NBC drama pilot, Jenna Bans and Bill Krebs’ Grosse Pointe Garden Society, which is not really a procedural, but Underhill teased a pending NBC pickup for a true procedural and shared whether Dick Wolf could expand his broadcast portfolio to four procedural franchises. DEADLINE: What kind of expectations did you have at the studio and what did you think about the way the UTV procedurals have performed coming back? ERIN UNDERHILL: We were beyond happy. We’ve heard so much chatter about the decline in broadcast. And so the fact that all of the UTV crime procedurals returned to either their ratings from the previous season or, in some cases, actually higher than where they ended the previous season, was a huge victory in our minds. And the fact that we have nine Wolf shows, and that those grew their audiences by double-digit percentages from where they left off is truly a feat in a time where we’re coming on the heels of a strike and we had to really scramble and get the scripts written, the episodes prepped, shot, edited and on the air. It just speaks to the team effort across the board, from the producers to my studio team, working 24/7 to deliver these shows to the audience. DEADLINE: Can you share more about the logistics of how you were able to get the Wolf NBC series on the air in mid-January, about a month ahead of any other returning broadcast scripted series? Did you even break for the holidays? UNDERHILL: For the holidays, we definitely took a break. But I think what it really stems from is the fact that the team that we have assembled, both the studio team here and obviously the show writers and the producers that make the shows, the crew if you will, they have an expertise in this because the Dick Wolf empire, it’s folks who have such a keen sense of what has to get accomplished. It’s a well-oiled machine, I think that’s pretty widely known, and I think this task showed everyone — as opposed to just telling people — that it’s a well-oiled machine by being able to get these scripts and these stories broken and written up and shot and edited and on the air. I feel like it was a mad dash. I’m not saying people didn’t work weekends. My team worked weekends because we would get a script in oftentimes on a Friday or Saturday and we would drop anything to read it and we would literally turn around notes within 24 hours, because we knew how hand to mouth everybody was with the material and how our response time was going to be vital to giving the writers the time they needed to make the adjustments and then get the scripts out into the actors hands to learn the lines, etc, etc. So it is like that domino effect and everyone had to pull their weight and then some, and it’s just fantastic to see when the whole team comes together and rows in the same direction what we can accomplish. DEADLINE: You didn’t have any scripts banked, so this was starting from zero, right? UNDERHILL: This is from ground zero. So yes, we hit the ground running when the strike ended and material came fast and furiously. DEADLINE: Why do you think have the ratings been held up so well? Was it extra anticipation created by the delay due to the strikes? UNDERHILL: I think for me, I’m speaking of myself as a viewer, I think people love this sense of reliable storytelling for audiences. You know you’re coming to something where you’re going to get a beginning, middle and end, and it’s going to get wrapped up. I think there’s real comfort knowing you can tune into an episode that feels self-contained, get to know the characters quickly and enjoy the story when justice is doled out at the end of that hour. And I think also they’re well told stories. The quality of these procedurals that UTV produces, I think they rival any show, let alone any procedural out there, they’re just so well done. And it starts with the written word and the team of writers who do the research and find these really compelling stories to tell and they do so beautifully. I also think people are really busy, and I think they like knowing that if they missed one week, they can pop in week two and be just as engaged, just as satisfied, just as riveted but don’t feel that time commitment, oh, I missed the last one, I have to go back and watch that before I watch it. So there’s that flexibility in viewing as well, which I think was a plus. DEADLINE: The procedurals’ nature of close-ended storytelling has been part of their ratings resilience. Maybe the fact that viewers could go into new episodes nine months after the previous season finales not having to remember any deep mythology helped get people tune in after the long break. UNDERHILL: I do think that’s definitely part of it as well, they know that they’re going to get a satisfying 43-44 minutes of television, and that it’s going to hold their attention because these stories move at such a quick clip. There’s such pace to the narrative that it draws you in from get go and then you’re off and running in terms of whodunnit and asking will they get convicted if it’s a Law & Order. DEADLINE: We have written a lot about the pressure on TV budgets, with some network dramas being made for as low as $3M-$4M an episode. That’s another thing Dick Wolf is known for, producing efficiently. Is this part of why you think so many Wolf shows have been around for so long? UNDERHILL: I think you hit the nail on the head. When you look at something like SVU which just celebrated its 25th anniversary, which is unbelievable in this business today, you look at the price point and it’s quite remarkable. They are very disciplined in terms of how they spend their money. The money is on the screen, that is for sure. I’m always in awe of how they’re able to accomplish what they can accomplish in terms of the scope of these episodes, knowing what the bottom line number is. That’s where they have the infrastructure that they can use some flexibility if you will and really lean on that Wolf machine to get what they need and to get it quickly and to get it at a price point and also to get it so it looks fantastic. Because we’re lucky to work with, I would personally say the best in the business, be it from these episodic directors and the writing team that knows how to write to scope but at the same time, the realities of what they’re going to be able to grab when they’re out in the streets of New York or Chicago. DEADLINE: Another thing Wolf series are known for are cast changes. SVU is different, it is Mariska Hargitay’s show, but for the others, it’s more about the franchise than it is about the casts which are tweaked every season, with leads sometimes departing. The shows have carried on and continue …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> TV -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Behind him, a virtual rendition of the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River began to move across the massive screens. Spielberg, however, was not shooting an upcoming film. He wasn’t directing at all. Spielberg was the star of this shoot, a promotional project called “Land of Stories,” meant to tee up NBC’s upcoming coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Spielberg’s involvement is part of a larger push connected to this year’s games, with NBC deciding to lean into celebrities and famous faces: In the promotions ahead of the event, in live coverage, and in packaged segments. Related Stories That includes Peyton Manning and Kelly Clarkson, who will join Mike Tirico as hosts of the opening ceremony July 26, and Jimmy Fallon, who will co-host the closing ceremony alongside Tirico, Johnny Weir, Tara Lipinski and Terry Gannon. During the games, celebrities like Snoop Dogg and Leslie Jones will serve as correspondents, with Snoop popping up at famous spots around Paris. Jones, Manning, and Call Her Daddy podcast host Alex Cooper will conduct interviews, with Cooper also hosting a watch party for Peacock, where Kenan Thompson and Kevin Hart will host a highlights show. Commercials previewing the games have starred Manning, Cardi B, and Paris Hilton. And NBC is sending Saturday Night Live Weekend Update host Colin Jost to Tahiti to cover the surfing competition (the surfing play-by-play announcers will be calling the event from Connecticut). “The Olympics really are a combination of all the genres on TV that people love,” says Molly Solomon, the executive producer of NBC’s Olympics coverage, and the president of production. “And as Steven Spielberg said [in the commercial], that’s a template for a great story, particularly in this age of cynicism.” The last two Olympics – the COVID-delayed Tokyo games in 2021 and the 2022 winter games in Beijing – were not what NBC was hoping for. The pandemic meant that strict protocols were in place, leading to mostly empty, quiet venues, while family members stayed in the U.S. and watched on TV. The network did its best to bring some emotion to its broadcasts but executives have acknowledged that the production didn’t have the drama and excitement that having everyone in the same room brings. One senior NBC executive said that the last “normal” Olympics may have been the 2012 London games, with Rio 2016 being dominated by Zika Virus concerns, and the conversation in Sochi 2014 centered around Russia’s human rights issues. They view 2024 as a reset, both in terms of returning to pre-COVID production standards, and as part of a larger effort to bring in younger audiences who may not remember what the games used to be like. “This is the one thing that actually brings 200-plus nations and territories together in peace and enjoyment,” Tirico says. “So without getting too Pollyanna about it, I think it’s a great time for it and a great place for it.” The cornucopia of celebrities is in that regard a conscious effort to bring new people to the Olympics, or bring some who lapsed during the pandemic back into the fold. “It’s not just throwing names on the marquee,” Tirico says. “It’s more of a collective effort to connect with viewers who maybe wouldn’t otherwise be coming. Get them in the tent, and most people who come into the Olympic tent end up enjoying it.” NBC is also planning a social media onslaught, enlisting 27 creators on TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, Meta, and Overtime to join them in Paris and cover the stories on the ground. “They are going over to Paris with us so that they can tell the story of the Olympics through their unique lens,” says Jenny Storms, the CMO of entertainment and sports for NBCUniversal, adding that the creators will have “unprecedented” access at the games. For many Gen Z consumers, the creators are probably far more familiar to them than the celebrity hosts. According to Storms, the company conducted research asking consumers about the Olympics and their media habits, leading to its new approach to the games. “We were just asking them, what does spark conversation in your life? What are some of the things that then end up being your conversations?” Storms says. “And the answer, unsurprisingly, was, oh, it’s celebrity, something happens with celebrity. And so that was the kernel and the nugget.” The result is apparent in its coverage plans, with correspondents like Snoop and Jost, but also celebrities taking over roles that in the past had been the fiefdoms of NBC News reporters: The profiles and interviews. Manning profiled shotput star Ryan Crouser; Cooper interviewed Simone Biles; Jones spoke to Katie Ledecky. Executives say the results prove out their thesis, with Solomon noting that Jones and Ledecky struck up a friendship after the Rio games, Manning was excited to tease out Crouser’s football past, and Cooper brought out a side of Biles that hadn’t been seen in other interviews. “I’ve watched her [Biles] interviewed many times. I’ve never seen her like that,” Tirico says of Cooper’s interview with Biles. “When you hear this piece, it’s Katie, I would say more honest and candid than ever before,” Solomon says of Jones’ interview. “I do think these famous faces and new voices are really helping to bring out the personalities to the athletes, and hopefully connect them to a new a new viewership demo.” While the athletes and the athletic feats will still be the stars of the games, NBC clearly believes that a little extra star power – whether it is Snoop Dogg at Versailles, Cooper interviewing Biles, or Jost surfing in Tahiti — can help rejuvenate a broadcast that had been tempered by the pandemic, even if the basic formula remains more or less the same. “What do these celebrities do? It allows us to have different ways to tell the stories we’ve told for years,” Tirico says, noting the “celebrity culture” in the U.S. “So I applaud our folks for one, going down that road. And secondly, if there has been an erosion in that large block of people who would come to the Olympics no matter what, this allows us to tap into different sources of people to reconnect that Olympic passion.” THR Newsletters Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Sports -> General News & Strategy"}]}

But the turnaround plan might not be enough to save Paramount Global from seeing its debt rating cut to junk status by credit-rating agency Moody’s. In a note Tuesday, Moody’s placed Paramount’s debt rating on review for a downgrade, citing “the ongoing secular pressures on the company’s television networks and the slow pivot to reach direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming scale,” along with the announcement of Skydance-Paramount pact. The upshot: Moody’s said it is “possible we could downgrade the ratings in the coming months, well before the pending merger closes.” Because junk debt securities have a lower credit rating than investment-grade securities, companies have to issue them at higher interest rates to attract buyers. Popular on Variety As part of the pact, Skydance and its financial backer, RedBird Capital, have pledged $1.5 billion in cash to help pay down Paramount’s debt. As of the end of March 2024, Paramount Global’s long-term debt stood at $14.6 billion. “Moody’s believes that the company will endeavor to build on its own franchises as outlined in the Skydance Consortium new strategic plan,” the agency wrote. “But without much more avid [intellectual property] such as more evergreen franchises to build on or heavier investment by Paramount, we believe that the company may remain competitively disadvantaged. Therefore, either a new materially different strategy is needed or it is possible that the initial investment into the company by the Skydance consortium may not be sufficient to stabilize the credit profile.” Speaking on a presentation for Paramount Global investors Monday, RedBird Capital partner Andy Gordon said the Skydance investor group expects the combined company “to be investment-grade by all rating agencies sometime in 2026.” The Skydance team expects debt-to-operating-income ratio to decline from approximately 4.3x for stand-alone Paramount Global (as of Q1 2024) to 2.4x by 2027. Separately, this March, Paramount Global‘s debt rating was cut to junk status by credit-rating agency S&P Global, which cited the media conglomerate’s ongoing challenges with free cash flow generation relative to its debt. In a note Tuesday, S&P Global said it is holding its rating on Paramount Global for now and that the merger with Skydance “doesn’t yet affect credit quality.” S&P now has a issuer credit rating on Paramount Global and its senior unsecured debt of of “BB+,” which is the highest “speculative grade” debt rating. The agency said it view the Skydance-Paramount merger announcement “as positive” but that it will “continue to monitor the transaction.” The companies anticipate the deal closing by Sept. 30, 2025, and that 14-month window “presents a potential risk for the company as worsening secular industry pressures (and the potential for macroeconomic headwinds) could impede the company’s ability to achieve its strategic and financial targets,” S&P Global wrote. All of Paramount Global’s debt is at a fixed rate and the company has no material near-term debt maturities coming due. The company also has an untapped $3.5 billion line of credit. Paramount paid down $1 billion of debt in Q4 2023. In addition, this spring Paramount Global announced an agreement to sell its 13% stake in India’s Viacom18 for $517 million, and proceeds from that transaction are expected to go toward paying down debt. The company’s current trio of co-CEOs further have announced they are looking at different asset sales to help lower Paramount’s debt load.

Best of all, they can recreate and use the powers of those characters to advance their own story. “What If...?” director and executive producer Dave Bushore says that their approach to the project, which was released for free May 30, was as free from limitations as the show that inspired it. “The constraints were only how many times could we ask ‘What if?’ of ourselves,” Bushore tells Variety. Popular on Variety Led with trademark cantankerousness by Doctor Strange’s sorcerer counterpart Wong, a “What If...?” participant learns how to repeat the movements of the characters to open portals and utilize the power of the Infinity Stones. Bushore says that even though the story was untethered from the proper Marvel canon, they wanted to integrate characters that MCU fans knew — just in unique ways. “When we were developing this, it was ‘What’s it been in the past? What was it in the movies?’ And we took that [approach] with the teenage Hela character,” he says, referring to a pint-sized version of the “Thor” foe. “To all of the characters, [she has] a different perspective,” he explains. “She comes at the story from a place of, ‘I don’t actually want to do hero stuff, I just want to get my friend back’.” Bushore says that he encouraged writers David Dong and Phil McCarty to take a similar approach with the Infinity Stones themselves. “The Soul Gem is an iconic piece of Marvel storytelling. So being able to take that and go, ‘let’s use it differently,’ was fun.” In order to develop the hourlong, mixed-reality experience, Bushore worked hand in hand with ILM Immersive executive producer Shereif M. Fattouh, who previously worked on “Ralph Breaks VR” and “Damage Control,” experiences created for virtual reality environment, the Void. “Getting to the point where you had a headset that can do this crystal clear pass-through and detect your hands and not have controllers, we had been thinking about that for a long time,” says Fattouh. “So we’ve just been really excited about doing it narrative-focused versus a traditional game.” Bushore says they employed classic storytelling techniques to set up the experience before inviting the viewer to become an active participant. “Traditional media, people have an understanding of — an intro, an outro, an action sequence,” he says. So what we did specifically was have 2D flat media that tells an emotional story to the characters that you are about to participate with, before you go into a three-dimensional space that you are now the main character in.” Fattouh highlights one of the key differences between immersive, experiences and traditional media. “It is very odd to not be able to cut,” he says. The solution they discovered was to use cinematic vignettes — short narrative clips that unfold like “shards” from the shattering multiverse — that serve as gateways to interactive sequences. “We brought in the amazing team at Flying Bark that works on the actual [“What If...?”] show so that we were able to have traditional forms of the series in a ‘shard’,” he says. “So that you do have a lot of dramatic cuts, more classic cinematography that can take place to tell a story, but then when we’re in our AR and VR moments.” Developing projects for the Void, and even the Oculus Quest and Rift headsets gave them an advantage when conceiving this project for the Apple Vision Pro, even if the Apple device’s absence of a handset or more traditional controller presented them with new challenges. “We knew the basics of what works well, what kind of gestures are comfortable. Because there’s a ton of stuff that’s like, ‘that’s going to be awesome,’ but you do it, and it didn’t give me the feeling that I wanted to have,” Fattouh remembers. “It’s fictionally right, but it’s not physically right.” He says that it took a lot of trial and error to create a harmonious experience between the traditional and interactive elements. “The Time Stone moment is such a great [example],” Fattouh says. “Where Hela is, where Wong is, when the Time Stone comes out, what we’re asking you to do, the framing was in a very cinematic style even though it was interactive, to really craft an emotional beat with the traditional techniques of cinematic filmmaking.” In the wake of ILMxLAB re-branding as ILM Immersive, many of the company’s previous interactive experiences effectively disappeared; though projects like “Avengers: Damage Control” were well-attended at Void locations and otherwise critically acclaimed, their complexity prevented them from being transferred (or translated) to consumer consoles such as the Oculus headsets used for “Vader Immortal.” Bushore and Fattouh suggest that “What If...?” not only offers participants with a multifaceted — and potentially update-able — experience that rewards multiple viewings, but just scratches at the surface of what they hope to do within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “There’s a lot there for folks that are interested to go back in,” says Fattouh. “But the possibilities are really endless. I mean, the method of this kind of content and how it’s distributed, it’s not a stretch to imagine that there can be things that get added.” Adds Bushore, “when you release something into the wild, most of the times you can’t change it. We can change this. We can literally react to some degree in real time to what the audience is thinking about.” Whether or not they will, of course, will likely come down to how many people actually get to try out the hour-long experience, which is currently available exclusively on the Apple Vision Pro. (In April 2024, Apple projected 400,000 to 450,000 first-year sales of the headset, whose $3,500 price tag limits access to the device, much less its content.) Bushore admits he’s unsure exactly what’s next for Marvel Studios in the VR space, but after trying to answer the question asked by “What If..,?,” he’s particularly bullish about the future of interactive storytelling. “I grew up watching stories about being able to go into computer simulations, and now we have that capability,” Bushore says. “To put people in spaces with characters to make them feel things, it’s the core of why we tell stories in the first place. And I can’t wait to do it again.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strategy & Miscellaneous News -> General News & Strategy"}]}

The film, the debut feature of director Rich Peppiatt and the first Irish-language feature to play Sundance, premiered on Thursday night at the Prospector Square Theater to critical acclaim, after which the band played a set at the after-party at The Cabin on Main Street. The three-piece also brought along an armoured Northern Irish police van for a stunt ahead of the first screening (in 2022, they unveiled a controversial mural of a similar van on fire in Ireland). Popular on Variety “Kneecap” follows the emergence of the riotous rap trio in post-Troubles Belfast, setting the stage for the Irish language’s resurgence against the establishment. Self-proclaimed “low life scum” Liam Óg and Naoise, along with school teacher JJ, become a political symbol and the defiant voice of Ireland’s restless youth. As they struggle to make their mark on the world and family and relationship pressures threaten to pull the plug on their dreams, the trio weave a narrative that transcends music. The film is described as “a true-life fable about man’s intrinsic urge for identity, the allure of drugs and a passion for life” and a “thrilling ride pulsating with hip-hop beats.” Naoise Ó Cairealláin aka Móglaí Bap, Liam Óg Ó Hannaidh aka Mo Chara and JJ Ó Dochartaigh aka Dj Provaí all playing themselves in the film, alongside co-stars Fassbender, Josie Walker, Fionnuala Flaherty, Jessica Reynolds, Adam Best and Simone Kirby. “Kneecap” was written and directed by Peppiatt from a story by Peppiatt, Ó Cairealláin, Óg Ó Hannaidh and Ó Dochartaigh. It was produced by Trevor Birney and Jack Tarling. The film was financed by the BFI, awarding National Lottery funding; Fís Éireann/Screen Ireland; Coimisiún na Meán; TG4 and Northern Ireland Screen’s Irish Language Broadcast Fund and Screen Fund. It is presented in association with Great Point Media, Naughty Step, DMC Film and is a Fine Point Films, Mother Tongues Films and Curzon production in in co-production with Wildcard. AC Independent and Charades handled the sale on behalf of the filmmakers. U.K./Ireland rights have already been sold to Curzon and Wildcard.

The Live-Action Series, from Greg Berlanti‘s Berlanti Productions and Warner Bros. Television, where the company is based, sources tell Deadline. Written by Josh Appelbaum & Scott Rosenberg (Cowboy Bebop) based on characters created by Hanna-Barbera, Scooby-Doo! is a live-action update of the popular cartoon. In a tough TV marketplace, the drama project garnered interest from top buyers, ending up at Netflix with a premium, script-to-series commitment, sources said. Reps for Netflix and WBTV declined comment. Scooby-Doo! The Live-Action Series is executive produced by Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter and Leigh London Redman for Berlanti Productions as well as Appelbaum and Rosenberg alongside André Nemec and Jeff Pinkner under their Midnight Radio banner. Berlanti Productions’ Jonathan Gabay and Midnight Radio’s Adrienne Erickson co-executive produce. Watch on Deadline The deal comes on the heels of Netflix releasing Berlanti Productions/WBTV’s latest series, Dead Boy Detectives, last week. The comic book adaptation landed on the streamer’s daily Top 10 U.S. series list within 24 hours and stayed in the Top 3 all weekend. At Netflix, Berlanti Productions and WBTV are also behind You, headed into its fifth and final season, and Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Created by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, the Scooby-Doo! franchise was launched in 1969 with the duo’s first animated series Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! for then-Hanna-Barbera (later absorbed into Warner Bros. Animation). The series, which introduced supernatural mysteries-solving teens Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley and Shaggy Rogers and their talking Great Dane Scooby-Doo, originally aired on CBS from 1969-76, when it moved to ABC, where various versions of the show aired until 1986. Spinoff A Pup Named Scooby-Doo! aired from 1988-91. Two Scooby-Doo! reboots premiered as part of Kids’ WB on The WB and its successor The CW from 2002-08. Further reboots were produced for Cartoon Network beginning in 2010 and continuing through 2018. Boomerang premiered original animated series Scooby-Doo! and Guess Who? on its streaming service in 2019 and later on Max. The franchise’s latest spinoff, Max original Velma from Mindy Kaling, recently wrapped its second season on the WBD streamer which also is home of the Scooby-Doo! library. A live-action film was released in 2002 starring Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and Linda Cardellini as Velma. It spawned a 2004 sequel. An animated feature, Scoob!, was released during the pandemic. This marks Appelbaum, Rosenberg and their Midnight Radio partners’ return to Netflix, where they executive produced the live-action Cowboy Bebop series adaptation.

One wrong move, and the player falls to their demise. But as the players progressed, they hit upon a revelation: Yes, there will only be one winner of the final game, but if they work together, they can cross the chasm and survive for one more day. Netflix, led by co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, has won the streaming wars (Morgan Stanley proclaimed it “The Undisputed” in a Jan. 23 research note, and the next day Bernstein declared the company “clearly the winner in streaming”), and the company and Wall Street see plenty more room to grow. Related Stories But even as Netflix appears poised to reign as the streaming champion, it also finds itself more open than ever to partnering with its competitors-turned-suppliers, perhaps even helping them get through the messy slog from linear TV to streaming...all with a healthy dose of self-interest, of course. It’s a counterintuitive thing, and yet: Netflix appears more eager than ever to acquire films and TV shows from other studios, and is paying substantially more than it did in the early days of streaming, when those same studios sold their content — the “lifeblood” of their business — “for pennies on the dollar,” MoffettNathanson’s Michael Nathanson noted in a Jan. 24 report. And perhaps more significantly: As Netflix leans into advertising as its big growth opportunity, it is floating the idea of more aggressive and opportunistic bundles with those same companies. (Could a Netflix-Max-Peacock discounted offering be on the horizon?) “We’re still very much in the early days of the ‘turn-a-profit phase’ for streamers and I’d expect to see less content and more bundling, ads and long-term subscription offers as the business of streaming matures,” says Scott Purdy, national media industry leader for KPMG. “[Tuesday’s] results show going back to the basics — ads and bundling — will be the blueprint other streaming companies follow to turn a profit.” For other companies in streaming, the rush to turn a profit has turned into a battle against churn. It isn’t just about acquiring new subscribers, it’s also about keeping them. And it turns out bundles are an effective way to reduce churn. “Lower-priced tiers and bundles that spread out costs could make it easier for more people to maintain subscriptions — and for streamers to sustain revenues,” the consultancy Deloitte wrote in its 2024 TMT Predictions report. Indeed, on its quarterly earnings call, Netflix co-CEO Peters, when asked about striking deals with partners on bundles, was enthusiastic about their potential to boost the company’s ad tier. “It’s very effective, very useful for us because that lower consumer-facing price means that we’ve got room now to bundle the ads plan into a set of lower-priced partner offerings where it was hard to make the economics work for everyone previously,” Peters said. “So we really think of this as a win-win-win and we’re going to continue to leverage these bundles going forward.” Verizon currently offers a bundle of ad tiers of Netflix and Max for $10 per month, but Peters’ comments certainly suggest that more bundles are imminent. And then there’s the licensed content. By now everyone in Hollywood knows that Netflix is an eager buyer of films and series. In fact, Netflix seems to have become the buyer of choice for many companies. What other platform has Sex and the City, Grey’s Anatomy, Star Trek: Prodigy, The Super Mario Bros. Movie in one place? Or to hear Sarandos explain it: “I am thrilled that the studios are more open to licensing again, and I’m thrilled to tell them that we are open for business.” “Against all odds, Netflix has succeeded in disrupting an industry where the incumbents once held the single most important resource: control of proprietary IP,” Nathanson added. “Even though this strategy is making Netflix stronger and more efficient, Netflix’s competitors appear willing to keep feeding the beast.” But there may be a method to the madness, and a clear rationale, for both Netflix and the other entertainment giants. Yes, Disney, Paramount, WBD et al are getting paid, but Sarandos argues that streaming their shows on Netflix helps their platforms, too. “Because of our recommendation and our reach, we can resurrect a show like Suits and turn it into a big pop culture moment,” Sarandos said. “I believe because of our distribution heft and our recommendation system that we can uniquely add more value to Studios’ IP than they can. Not all the time, but sometimes, and we’re the best buyer for it.” It’s also part of the argument for the $5 billion WWE deal, with the wrestling company still trying to expand beyond the United States, Canada, U.K. and a handful of international markets. “WWE can leverage Netflix’s global reach and massive subscriber base to grow awareness of the sport in new international markets,” Bank of America’s Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote Jan. 23. And not only does Netflix receive a constantly refreshed fountain of content with these deals, but it can also land some legitimate bargains. With a deep menu of content from other companies to choose from, “it might be that we can deliver more on our programming spend with some licensed titles,” Sarandos acknowledged Jan. 23. Despite the olive branch, a top advertising source expressed caution, comparing Netflix’s strategic moves to letting a fox into the henhouse. Netflix’s ad business is small, and it does not expect it to be a meaningful driver of revenue this year. That is expected to change in 2025. The concern for the likes of Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal is that as Netflix scales up its ad business, it will come for their ad dollars, siphoning budgets that would otherwise be going to broadcast or cable TV, or streaming services like Peacock or Paramount+. It’s a threat looming from Amazon Prime Video, which will turn on ads for its members Jan. 29. “Given its size, Netflix can amortize the content it licenses from competitors across a larger subscriber base and as the ad plan rolls out can sell more ads on a single piece of licensed content,” Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a Jan. 24 note. In other words, Netflix may be able to monetize acquired content better than the third-party studios can, a difficult situation for those companies to be in. “Traditional media companies are back to the same place they found themselves 10 to 15 years ago: between a rock and hard place,” Nollen added, referencing the conundrum facing legacy studios: cash now, or hoard content for their own platforms? “The bigger Netflix gets, the more other studios will want to license its content, which then puts them in the familiar quandary of how to grow their own DTC services successfully in response.” This moment in some ways is a textbook example of “what’s old is new.” The strategic shifts by Netflix are a significant departure from the company’s original streaming premise. But it’s likely to be a very profitable pivot, one that bears a striking resemblance to, well, cable TV. The adjustments from the company “all portend for a much more profitable Netflix in the coming years,” Nathanson writes. “A few years back, at the start of the streaming wars, we argued that Netflix’s forced shift into greater and greater original content investment would be far tougher than their initial strategy of using other people’s content. Now, due to industrywide challenges, Netflix has been able to flip that model back.” This story appeared in the Jan. 26 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. Click here to subscribe.

The vibe at the first Comcast Converge was a bit upfront-ish, hosted by SNL’s Keenan Thompson for a New York contingent that’s not part of Comcast’s footprint including financial analysts, press and partners. “Technology has definitely changed how people watch [SNL],” said Thompson. “Fans will still come up to me and say they saw me on TV last night. But just as many folks say, ‘I saw you on YouTube,’ or ‘I loved you on Instagram.’ Or ‘You were very funny on Black-ish. I tell them that it’s not me, it’s Anthony Anderson, and at least they can Google ‘Who is Anthony Anderson’.” There were Gritty jokes and Wawa jokes, a nice connectivity ad produced by Kathryn Bigelow, and alluring spots of the upcoming Summer Olympics in Paris, of which Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said, “There’s no better example of how our whole company works well together.” Watch on Deadline Seth Meyers (of Late Night With Seth Myers) beamed in virtually. So “2014 might not seem that long ago, but back then we didn’t even have the capacity to “thumbs up” a text message — you had to take a photograph of your thumb and send it.” “Ten year ago, my appliances didn’t know each other. Last year, my toaster and my fridge celebrated their third wedding anniversary.” “Ten years ago, kids just learned how to read and write. Now they are learning how to tell AI to do it for them.” Roberts seemed moved during his remarks at the Ralph J Roberts Forum, named after his late father who “founded Comcast in 1963 with just 1,200 subscribers.” He called the space at Comcast’s center city campus “the heart and soul of the technology center, and maybe the whole company.” Comcast, he wanted to stress, has “a culture that has successfully embraced change.” “I don’t know what the next 10 years are going to look like. But I know that we have a pretty amazing starting place,” he said. “We’re betting on a future that has way more connectivity.” Connectivity — broadband, wireless, WiFi — is keeping Comcast solidly positioned even as linear subscribers fall away and shifts in the media landscape rattle peers like Paramount Global, Warner Bros Discovery and Disney. Deep pockets mean the company is always seen as a prospective buyer in deal speculation, of which there’s been a lot lately. Comcast acquired NBCUniversal in full from GE in 2013. It was thwarted in a hostile takeover attempt for Disney in 2004. It also bid against Disney for 20th Century Fox in 2018. Roberts and president Mike Cavanagh say they look at everything but are fine with Comcast’s assets as is. The company posted a strong fourth quarter and 2023 last month — “returned $16 billion to shareholders last year, invested heavily in new products and raised its dividend for the 16th year running,” said Roberts. “I don’t think too many companies on the planet can say that.” Peacock’s landmark AFC Wild Card game in January was a major Internet moment and drove paid signups to the streaming service. Dave Watson, CEO of Comcast Cable, kicked off today’s presentations by a stream of executives on products and services, ad tech and security, voice remotes, Xfinity, 10G (Gbps, or broadband connections) and its ongoing push to give customers new features, faster service and a clearer picture. The Paris Olympics, set for July 26-August 11, were top of mind for Roberts. “For 17 days, we put aside our differences globally in our society ... I think I speak for a whole lot of people when I say the world could use that inspiration right now. After a few difficult years due to Covid, stadiums will be full for the first time since 2018.

There are several “Zorro” reboots in the pipeline, including a film which will be directed by Jonás Cuarón starring Gael García Bernal, and a series helmed by Javier Quintas which is produced by Secuoya Studios and is being sold around the world by Mediawan Rights. Paramount+ unveiled yesterday the launch date and pricing for its international AVOD subscription offering, the so-called “Basic (with ads)” plan, in Australia and Canada.

Warner Bros. Discovery this week pulled the entire contents of cartoonnetwork.com offline — redirecting visitors to a landing page on Max, its subscription-streaming service, encouraging fans to sign up to watch their favorite Cartoon Network shows. The shuttering of the site appears to have happened Thursday, Aug. 8. “Looking for episodes of your favorite Cartoon Network shows? Check out what’s available to stream on Max (subscription required),” a pop-up message says on the new Max landing page. “Sign up for Max, where you can also create a Kids Profile with ratings restrictions and additional privacy protections to keep it fun and kid-friendly! Cable subscribers, continue to enjoy your favorite CN programming on your TV and connected apps as well!” In a statement, a Cartoon Network spokesperson told Variety: “We are focusing on the Cartoon Network shows and social media where we find consumers are the most engaged and there is a meaningful potential for growth.” The rep noted that on linear TV, the Cartoon Network will continue to offer 11 hours of programming from 6 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. Popular on Variety The Cartoon Network site had previously offered full episodes and video clips for its roster of shows, including “Adventure Time,” “Craig of the Creek,” “The Amazing World of Gumball,” “Teen Titans GO!,” “Steven Universe,” “We Bare Bears” and “Clarence.” The site also offered access to free games, including games for “Teen Titans GO!”, “Adventure Time” and “Gumball.” The shutdown of cartoonnetwork.com comes a week after WBD told subscribers it will sunset the Boomerang classic ‘toon streamer effective Sept. 30 — and migrating customers (and the content catalog) over to Max. WBD’s killing off of the Cartoon Network appears to be a cost-cutting move, as well as one intended to spur fans to pay up for Max. In a series of similar moves, Paramount Global earlier this summer removed a huge trove of content from Comedy Central’s site and pulled the full archive of MTV News and CMT from the internet. This is what the Cartoon Network landing page on max.com looked like on Friday: On Wednesday, Warner Bros. Discovery reported Q2 revenue of $9.71 billion (down 6%) and a whopping net loss of almost $10 billion, driven by a $9.1 billion write-down for a drop in value of its cable TV networks. Subscribers to the company’s streaming services, led by Max, were down slightly domestically (dropping by about 300,000 to 52.4 million), while international streaming customers increased by 3.9 million in the period to 50.8 million."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> TV -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Discovery, just over two years after closing the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery, will be “opportunistic” about seeking M&A deals in the next two or three years, president and CEO David Zaslav said. “I think some companies will be for sale,” Zaslav said, speaking Thursday at the Bernstein 40th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference in New York. “We can be opportunistic but we’re going to be very disciplined.” “I think there’s likely going to be some consolidation. There are a lot of players. There are a lot of players that are losing a lot of money,” Zaslav said. “One of the reasons why we really fought to drive our free cash flow and pay down our debt is to be in a position — as we roll out globally, as we fight to build our business — that we’re a healthy company.” Popular on Variety Speaking of losing money, Warner Bros. Discovery reported full-year 2023 revenue of $41.3 billion, down 4% on a pro-forma basis, and a net loss of $3.13 billion (versus a net loss of $5.36 billion on a pro-forma basis in 2022). The media conglomerate during the first quarter of 2024 repaid $1.1 billion of debt to end the quarter with $43.2 billion of gross debt. “Over the next two to three years, I expect that there’s going to be some opportunities,” Zaslav said. “There’ll be some players that want to get out of the business, that will look to consolidate their streaming businesses with others. And so I think we will look to be opportunistic during that time,” he said, adding that he believes there will be 4-5 dominant global streaming platforms as things shake out. “The global nature of this business is going to require a number of players to decide whether they want to go it alone,” according to Zaslav. He said “consolidation can happen in a lot of different ways,” including through bundling — such as WBD and Disney’s forthcoming Disney+/Hulu/Max bundle — and he also suggested “over the long term some of the smaller players in streaming will end up wanting to be part of a bigger global organization.” Regarding Paramount Global — which has been in talks about a potential sale to Skydance Media and has been reviewing a joint bid from Sony Pictures-Apollo — Zaslav didn’t address WBD’s recent interest in exploring a merger with the company, but he commented in a lightning-round Q&A about Paramount, “Great storytelling heritage.” Zaslav met briefly late last year with Paramount’s then-CEO Bob Bakish to size up a potential merger but those talks didn’t continue. Meanwhile, on WBD’s potential loss of NBA rights, Zaslav said the company is continuing to talk with the league about a new deal. Asked to contemplate a future without NBA games, he responded, “We feel very comfortable, and we’ve been very strategically focused on making sure that we have a robust offering of sports for each of our sports channels in the U.S. and around the world.” “In general, we’re a leader in sports around the world,” he said. “Our job is to be very strategic about what content do we have... and making sure we have what we think creates real shareholder value.” He noted that WBD recently picked up college football rights sublicensed from ESPN. Zaslav said the strategy has been to yield “a very robust [sports] offering for consumers that they can watch on TNT in the U.S. all year round.” The NBA’s media rights deals with both Disney’s ESPN and Warner Bros. Discovery expire after the 2024-25 season. The league has already worked out deal frameworks with ESPN as well as Amazon Prime Video and NBCUniversal, per multiple reports, while Warner Bros. Discovery believes it has a right to try to match a deal offered by any rival. Warner Bros. Discovery’s Turner and the NBA have been allied since 1989, with the relationship growing so strong that Turner has helped operate the NBA’s cable TV network and manage some of its digital properties. About the WBD-Disney bundle with Disney+, Hulu and Max, Zaslav said that “if it works” it should reduce churn and provide a better overall customer experience. “Right now it’s a really challenging environment for consumers” to find content, he said. “I think it’s the beginning of this transition from people going to 10 different apps. Eventually, I think there’s going to be four or five,” Zaslav said, adding that he believes Max will be one of those. “On a very basic level, the more often you watch a product, the more people in the family that watch the product, the lower the churn,” he said. “The idea of Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney together is a very compelling offering. We think that will provide a more nourishing, better consumer experience.” Warner Bros. Discovery expects two-thirds of its Max subscriber growth going forward to come from international markets, Zaslav said, and the company is “hard bundling” Max with distributors like Canal+ in France. Zaslav also called out WBD’s joint venture with Disney and Fox Corp. for Venu Sports, an app that will bundle of live channels slated to launch in the fall of 2024. “It’s a different approach. We think it will be very attractive,” he said, but didn’t discuss pricing. It’s aimed at younger sports fans who don’t subscribe to traditional pay-TV services. As he has in the past, Zaslav touted WBD’s content franchises and argued that “the good news is a lot it has been underused,” citing the Harry Potter TV series greenlit for 10 consecutive seasons and Peter Jackson’s return to making a “Lord of the Rings” movie for Warner Bros. set for 2026 release. “We have some of these tentpole, IP storytelling content [franchises] that people know everywhere in the world,” the CEO said. “So whether it’s Superman or Batman or Wonder Woman, our whole DC franchise that James Gunn is really driving, or whether it’s ‘Harry Potter’ or ‘Lord of the Rings’ or ‘Game of Thrones,’ we sit with content.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Investor Relations -> General News & Strategy -> IR Conferences"}]}

The Debutantes is the story of an intergenerational group of Black women and girls in Canton, Ohio revitalizing the debutante ball, a once popular tradition of the Black middle class. Contessa is a non-fiction film director, DP, editor and an Emmy-nominated producer. She tells stories about identity, socio-political movement, healing, Black liberation and radical imagination. As an independent filmmaker, her work has been supported by Impact Partners, Field of Vision, Artemis Rising Foundation, the International Documentary Association, the California Arts Council and Queen Latifah’s Queen Collective. Filmed at the 2022 Cotillion, this coming-of-age film follows Canton’s first group of Black debutantes in over a decade as they prepare for their formal debut to society as young women. Long considered a symbol of middle class respectability, a new generation of Black girls, many growing up in a post-industrial, low-income community, must decide how much of this legacy they will embrace as a pathway to traditional ideas of advancement and success. Waltz lessons and etiquette classes clash with Gen Z sensibilities, as these high school juniors and seniors find their voices, their light and their own way forward. Watch on Deadline Through immersive cinema verite, archival imagery, personal video diaries and Tik Tok dance montages, the film introduces three main characters; Amelia, Dedra and Teylar, as they navigate issues of identity and gender norms, and grapple with the question of whether they must act and present in a certain way in order to realize their dreams of being the first in their family to go to college, or to become doctors or successful entrepreneurs. “The Debutantes is set against the backdrop of rites of passage and rituals, communal mothering and sistering, traumas and triumphs,” said Director Contessa Gayles. “The film bears witness to the lives of Black girls and creates space for us to be presented, as we rarely are — in our full humanity. Neither stereotyped, nor tokenized. Full of strength, resilience, yes, but also vulnerability and irreverence. Neither on pedestals, nor under anybody’s foot — just girls.” “The film was ignited by NBC News Studios development executive Reniqua Allen Lamphere whose mother shared an experience as a Black Debutante in the 70s,” said Molly O’Brien, Vice President/Head of Documentary for NBC News Studios. “We were then fortunate to be able to bring Contessa Gayles on as director, who had a personal connection to the story as well as a strong vision and artistic approach, immediately immersing herself with the girls, allowing them to control their own narratives. We are also privileged to partner with the teams at Westbrook, one of the most powerful Black owned studios, and BET Studios, who are incredible at nurturing and showcasing the work of Black talent.” “Westbrook jumped at the opportunity to support director Contessa Gayles in her creative vision of capturing this heartwarming coming of age portrait of extraordinary young Black girls in Canton, OH and the community of strong women elders supporting them. Through the vehicle of the Debutante Ball we witness the adversity and struggle, as well as the camaraderie and joy, of these young women as they navigate their last years of high school and into college. This was one of the first films we greenlit in launching the documentary division and has been a true labor of love. We are truly grateful for the collaboration and partnership with NBC News Studios, BET Studios and our filmmaking team”, said Jannat Gargi, Producer and former SVP Documentaries for Westbrook Studios. “BET Studios is proud to partner with NBC News Studios and Westbrook Studios in producing The Debutantes, which shines a light on the time-honored traditions of the Black cotillion,” said Aisha Summers Burke, Executive Vice President and General Manager, BET Studios. “Debutante pageants have played an integral role in Black society dating back hundreds of years and through the riveting storytelling of director Contessa Gayles, we celebrate the importance of this legacy through the lens of a new generation.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Film -> Development"}]}

The Nordic market has gone through a rough patch in the last few years after the fallout of negotiations between the Danish producers guild and streamers; and the major restructuring at Viaplay which has put the brakes on local originals and is now partly owned by France’s Canal+. All three Nordic originals greenlighted by Netflix are backed by renowned creatives and producers. Popular on Variety “Synden” is written and directed by Peter Grönlund whose credits include “Goliat” and “Beartown.” The series follows the perpetually angry, odd but highly intelligent investigator Dani (Krista Kosonen) who is teamed up with newly graduated police colleague Malik (Mohammed Nour Oklah) to investigate the murder of a teenager found dead at a farmhouse on the Bjäre peninsula. The investigation propels Dani and Malik at the center of a dark family feud that has been going on for generations and revolves around Patriarch Elis (Peter Gantman). Kosonen previously starred “The Midwife” and “Beforeigners.” A contemporary crime thriller series, “Synden” is produced by Bonnie Skoog Feeney and Mattias Arehn at Ninjahuset.

Per Nielsen data, Amazon received a 12% bump in streaming viewership from August, leading the streamer to match its platform-best share of overall TV viewership of 3.6%. The increase was driven largely by “Thursday Night Football” as well as the debut of Season 2 of “The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power,” which was this month’s third most watched streaming title with 4.3 billion viewing minutes. The NFL also boosted Peacock, which exclusively aired the Green Bay Packers vs. Philadelphia Eagles game on Sept. 6.

Popular on Variety Streaming overall in September 2024 was up 11% from September 2023, holding a 41% share of overall TV viewership despite declining 2.2% from August, in line with seasonal trends, per Nielsen. Accounting for 10.6% of total TV viewership in September was YouTube, which is the highest-represented streamer. Broadcast accounted for 22.6% and cable 26.1%. Disney+ also received a monthly bump of 5.2% up from August as the Mouse House notched a platform-best 2.5% share of overall TV viewership in September. Per Nielsen, Disney+ benefited from making Hulu content available on the platform for package subscribers. Also, the children’s show “Bluey” had a massive month with 4.2 billion minutes viewed.

Cable viewing in September dipped by 0.2% from August, coming off of a month filled with Olympics coverage and the four-day Democratic National Convention. The presidential debate helped offset the decline in sports, with almost 22 million viewers watching the Harris-Trump showdown on cable networks (Fox News accounted for 9 million of those).

Watch on Deadline In 2011, he began production on Nosotros Los Nobles starring Gonzalo Vega, Luis Gerardo Méndez, Karla Souza and Juan Pablo Gil which he directed/wrote/produced. The film was released by Warner Bros. in 2013 and it became the highest-grossing Mexican movie of all time. The film stayed in the Box Office Top 10 for 17 weeks -second place to Titanic (20 weeks). With 7.2 million viewers and 340 million pesos in box office sales, it doubled the record from the previous highest-grossing Mexican film in history.

Or is it defamation? Related Stories In the acclaimed show, Fairstein is portrayed as the face of a crooked criminal justice system hell-bent on securing convictions against five Black and Latino teenagers accused of raping a white jogger in Central Park (they were cleared many years later). Throughout the series, she’s depicted as directing officers to harshly interrogate the boys in violation of their constitutional rights, withholding crucial evidence and ultimately coercing the confessions that landed them in prison. Fairstein, who sued for defamation in 2020, alleges that this never happened. She’s not the only one to take issue with alleged inaccuracies in historical dramas. Other aggrieved subjects of film and TV productions that depict real people and use their real names include the royal family (The Crown), a swindler’s friend (Inventing Anna) and a Georgian chess champion (The Queen’s Gambit). As Netflix confronts a torrent of defamation lawsuits, a steadily growing body of case law is chipping away at legal protections once thought to provide sweeping cover for dramatizations. Lisa Callif, a lawyer who handles financing, production and legal clearance for productions, says scrutiny around dramatizations has increasingly created a “difficult dynamic” in which creatives must be warned against “embellishing things, like adding negative attributes or enhancing negative depictions.” She stresses, “Now we have this battery of cases going to our point. This makes us even more careful.” On June 4, Netflix and DuVernay settled with Fairstein in the closely watched case. Under the deal, Netflix agreed to move a portion of the dramatization disclaimer from the credits to the beginning of each episode. For Netflix, this case was about more than When They See Us or the $8 million the lawsuit sought. At stake in the litigation: artistic liberties wielded by creatives making films and TV shows chronicling real-life events. On this front, Netflix has steadily been losing ground. It rolled the dice letting the case go as far as it did, losing that gamble when the court found that a jury should decide whether Fairstein was defamed in five scenes. “The damage has already been done,” says Alexander Rufus-Isaacs, a lawyer who has represented plaintiffs in lawsuits against Netflix over alleged defamation in The Queen’s Gambit and Inventing Anna, referencing case law in the litigation that he predicts will be cited in lawsuits down the road. For DuVernay, making When They See Us was a chance to clarify history. As a high school junior in Compton applying to journalism schools when the crime became national news, she said she was wary even before the group was vindicated that “the news might not be true” and that the boys may have been being railroaded by the criminal justice system. So when Raymond Santana, one of the Central Park Five, tweeted at her in 2015 soliciting her involvement in a show about the case, DuVernay jumped at the opportunity. It was a chance for the director to tackle issues she’s dedicated her career to — issues of race, criminal justice and who gets to write history. It’s her telling of that history, and whether she was faithful to source materials she drew from to create the show, that was the subject of the lawsuit. For public figures like Fairstein, the bar for defamation is exceptionally high. Moving for dismissal of the lawsuit, Netflix and DuVernay argued that they didn’t act with “actual malice,” a legal standard for defamation requiring evidence that there were doubts about the accuracy of allegedly defamatory actions or reckless indifference to the truth. The show’s writers, they said, “absolutely believed that their overall portrayal” of Fairstein “reflected the essence of truth based on their multiple, trusted sources and research.” The court didn’t agree. It pointed to evidence that conduct is attributed to the ex-prosecutor that’s “unsupported by the writers’ substantial body of source materials.” One of the allegedly defamatory scenes shows Fairstein drafting a timeline of the rape that positions the five as responsible for the attack even though conflicting research described another prosecutor as the timeline’s author. “Had they just called her character Lucy Field, this case is very different,” says Andrew Miltenberg, a lawyer for Fairstein. Netflix did use different names in Richard Gadd’s Baby Reindeer, which draws upon Gadd’s experiences as it follows a struggling comedian who encounters a troubled woman at a bar where he works. Revealed as Fiona Harvey in a defamation lawsuit filed June 6, she’s depicted as a twice-convicted stalker who was sentenced to five years in prison for various crimes — and is called Martha in the series. Harvey faces an uphill climb in court, according to legal experts. “If they’re not identifiable, they can’t have a beef,” Rufus-Isaacs says. Findings in another lawsuit Netflix faced accusing it of defaming Nona Gaprindashvili, a Georgian chess champion in the 1970s who took issue with a line in The Queen’s Gambit stating that she “never faced men,” don’t help the streaming giant. In that case, the court rebuffed a bid to dismiss the lawsuit, rejecting arguments that the complaint didn’t sufficiently allege actual malice, the legal standard for defamation against public figures. Castel, the judge overseeing the When They See Us lawsuit, referenced that ruling in his order clearing the case for trial, concluding that the standard can be met “when a dramatization or fictional work includes a description of a real-life person that is contradicted by the source material.” He stressed, “As observed in Gaprindashvili, remarks about an actual person may be defamatory even when uttered by a character in a work of pure fiction.” In a court declaration, DuVernay stated that the show’s writers “had a huge amount of research material from a variety of sources and perspectives,” including five books, court transcripts and news articles. She said the sources almost universally painted Fairstein in an unfavorable light, especially after the convictions were overturned. One example: Michael Warren, a lawyer for some of the five, said in an interview that “Fairstein controlled those detectives.” DuVernay “had no doubt whatsoever” that the ex-prosecutor was central to the investigation and prosecution, was “morally and legally culpable” for the case’s outcome, and that “she crossed moral and ethical lines and breached the public trust,” she said. Zelda Perkins, a former assistant to Harvey Weinstein who served as a producer on The Crown, says that there are “a lot of checks and standards productions have to adhere to,” but that they’re ultimately “work[s] of fiction based on facts.” She also consulted with producers on She Said, a 2022 film following The New York Times reporters who took down the ex-movie mogul. Perkins stresses that processes for fact-checking scripts for historical inaccuracies are “clearly inadequate” in the “slight Wild West-type attitude that there is in the creative industry” on the issue. It didn’t help Fairstein that she declined an interview with DuVernay before the series was made either. Also lending credibility to DuVernay’s depiction of that the ex-prosecutor was that she facilitated introductions between Weinstein’s legal team and Manhattan’s lead sex crimes prosecutor when he was accused of groping an Italian model, who reported the incident to law enforcement. Another reason studios might pump the brakes on embellishments in dramatizations: insurance. Not only have premiums on such projects shot up — in some instances by as much as 250 percent in the past decade — but deductibles for some high-risk showrunners and writers can reach $250,000, according to lawyers at legal clearance houses for productions. Both sides declared victory after the When They See Us settlement. Netflix walked away without having to pay Fairstein anything, including her hefty legal bills, in an agreement that some lawyers said was too good to leave on the table. But it agreed to move the disclaimer. June 12, 7 pm PST Updated article to remove a mention that the disclaimer added to When They See Us was the first time that Netflix had added such a disclaimer.

Paramount, which released the movie over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, chose not to explicitly market it as a song-and-dance spectacle, according to the studio’s president of global marketing and distribution Marc Weinstock. “To start off saying musical, musical, musical, you have the potential to turn off audiences,” he says. “I want everyone to be equally excited.” Popular on Variety The PG-13 film triumphed in its box office debut with $33 million over the four-day weekend. But despite the cultural prominence of Tina Fey’s 2004 comedy, which propelled Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams and Amanda Seyfried to stardom, Weinstock’s job – selling the masses on (and clearing up any confusion about) “Mean Girls” – was trickier than trying to make fetch happen. The story is the same, following Cady Heron as she moves to Illinois from Africa and navigates the lawless jungle of high school. But this rendition – adapted from the Broadway show – has singing and dancing. It isn’t a remake or sequel, and there are new actors (“Sex Lives of College Girls” star Reneé Rapp and “Spider-Man: No Way Home” actor Angourie Rice led the cast) embodying the Plastics. “This is a movie within the ‘Mean Girls’ world,” Weinstock says. “We didn’t want to distill it down to one thing, because it’s not one thing.” Where do you start with marketing such a familiar property? There are two audiences: the audience that grew up with “Mean Girls,” and the audience that didn’t. On “Mean Girls” Day, which is Oct. 3, we released the entire movie on TikTok in 23 separate clips. Non-fans started watching and were like, “Wait, this is a great movie.” They immediately got familiar with the world. Some fans of the original felt strongly about the tagline, “This is not your mother’s ‘Mean Girls.'” What were you trying to convey? People kind of misconstrued it and took offense. All we meant to say was that it’s a new twist. People took it literally. “What do you mean? I’m not a mom!” We moved away from that and toward “A new twist from Tina Fey.” It’s her vision, and it’s fantastic. Did you intentionally avoid advertising the movie as a musical? We didn’t want to run out and say it’s a musical because people tend to treat musicals differently. This movie is a broad comedy with music. Yes, it could be considered a musical but it appeals to a larger audience. You can see in [trailers for] “Wonka” and “The Color Purple,” they don’t say musical either. We have a musical note on the title, so there are hints to it without being overbearing. How did you make it clear from the first trailer that new actors are playing Regina George and Cady Heron? Our first teaser was Reneé Rapp to the camera singing “My name is Regina George.” It did so much for us because immediately it said, “This is your new Regina. Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams are not in this movie.” We did have Tim [Meadows] and Tina in the spots to show familiarity. Did you take any lessons from another very pink movie, “Barbie”? It was the campaign of the year. They did a great job in ubiquity, and that’s the one thing we tried to do: be anywhere and everywhere. I get excited when people come up to me and say, “It’s on my [social media] feed every two seconds.” What kind of fun did you have with quotable lines from the 2004 film? We didn’t want to copy the lines exactly because we didn’t want people to think they were getting a version of the old movie. We used odes to it, like a bus ad that says “Look both ways, Regina!” It’s a funny line for those who know, and those who don’t know want to investigate it. We were conscientious that we weren’t like, “Here are all the lines from the first movie! It’s back again!” We wanted to show there was something fresh. I saw that people online were upset the premiere was held on a Monday and not a Wednesday. I know. That was due to talent availability. It’s a boring answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Film -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Discovery is likely to expire Monday without a new deal, according to people familiar with the matter. Beginning next week, the NBA will be able to work on agreements for new partners to show packages of games. Amazon, Apple, YouTube TV, Comcast's NBCUniversal/Peacock and Netflix have all had preliminary conversations with the league expressing potential interest, CNBC reported last year. The exclusive negotiating window with the league's incumbent partners officially ends Monday. While no agreement is expected to be announced by the deadline, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery both continue to work on terms with the league, an NBA spokesperson confirmed. The NBA would like to bring in at least one new partner to serve as a flagship streamer, CNBC reported last year. The league wants a \"robust\" streaming partner that will use marketing and reach to make the games a priority on their platform, CNBC reported. \"We continue to have productive discussions with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery on a renewal of our media deals,\" a league spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. Spokespeople for Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment. Warner Bros. Discovery's TBS began airing NBA games in 1984, and TNT has shown NBA games since 1988. Disney's ESPN and ABC have broadcast the NBA since 2002. The two companies have both publicly expressed a desire to renew with the NBA and have joined forces with Fox to launch a new streaming service geared to sports fans that don't already pay for cable. That service will debut in the fall, the companies said earlier this year. A more complex deal The NBA is looking to double the $24 billion it generated from its previous media rights deal with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery by adding new partners and charging more for rights, CNBC reported last year. In 2014, during the NBA's last negotiation, the league renewed its rights with Disney and Time Warner about five months before the end of its exclusive negotiating window. The NBA also doubled the price for its rights in that deal from its previous agreement. This time, the discussions with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are more complicated because of the likely addition of a third party. Both Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery aren't eager to lose the rights they already have. Still, the league is looking for a large increase in fees, and neither company wants to carry the full burden of paying significantly more for what they already have, according to people familiar with the negotiations. That allows for the league to bring in another party — or possibly even two more. The NBA could sell its new in-season tournament package of games to a separate media company other than its primary new streaming partner, one of the people said. The value of popular live sports programming has increased because of its value to advertisers. While ad-free subscription streaming services have increasingly become the home for popular scripted programming, sports are still predominantly watched live, forcing viewers to see commercials. Last year's NBA playoffs was the most watched in 11 years across TNT, ABC, ESPN and NBA TV, according to Nielsen. The 2023-24 NBA regular season averaged 1.09 million viewers, up 1% from last year and the highest across-network average in four years, according to SportsMediaWatch. Still, regular-season viewership plateaued this year among standard cable and broadcast networks. Across ABC, ESPN and TNT, the average televised audience of 1.56 million was down 1% from last year's 1.59 million and was the lowest in three years. TNT averaged 1.4 million viewers for its 65 regular-season games, equaling the year prior, according to a Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson. The first round of the NBA playoffs will start Saturday.

In a bid to win overall commitments, Disney has been striking deals that call for significant “rollbacks” in the rates it charges to reach 1,000 viewers — a measure known as a CPM — on its Disney+ streaming hub, according to six people with knowledge of recent discussions in the industry’s “upfront” market. Each year during the upfront, U.S. media companies try to sell the bulk of their commercial inventory for their next cycle of programming. Disney has in some cases agreed to reduce CPMs for Disney+ by as much as 10% to 15%, according to some of the executives. In exchange for the lowered rates, Disney is securing deals that call for a certain level of volume of ad support across its portfolio. But some of Disney’s rate capitulation has angered rivals, who had hoped not to roll back their numbers to such a degree, and are being forced to do so in order to match Disney’s offer. Popular on Variety “There are media partners who are going to be aggressive and try to win share,” says one media buying executive. Disney declined to make executives available for comment. TV’s money scramble takes place in one of the most difficult bargaining sessions in recent memory. Executives on both sides of the negotiating table agree that overall dollar volume is likely to be down. The dim outlook comes as advertisers move their dollars to streaming and digital media, where there is less pressure to place ad cash months in advance, which is what upfront bookings represent. What’s more, there is a significant increase of digital-video inventory available, thanks to Amazon Prime Video’s recent decision to make its basic streaming service ad-supported. The reduced demand and increased supply are hurting TV’s ad-sales efforts when the entire sector is in flux. More viewers are moving to on-demand streaming to watch their favorite dramas, comedies and movies, and, in more cases, sports. Such migration makes the job of offering big audiences — TV’s main distinction from competitors — exponentially more complex. Disney has pursued similar strategies in previous upfront markets. The tactic has been a favorite of Rita Ferro, the company’s president of ad sales, who has often tried to broker early pacts in upfront discussions since rising to her role in 2017. Disney’s decision comes with no small amount of risk. Executives caution that rate rollbacks can take years to reverse. Streaming is supposed to represent the future of the industry, but the rollbacks could undermine efforts in years to come to gain better pricing. If traditional TV continues to see audiences fragment around different screens and streaming opportunities, there’s no guarantee that Disney or one of its rivals will be able to make up any ground that has been lost. And the maneuver has had a ripple effect. NBCUniversal, which has hoped to deliver ad commitments on par with last year’s, has been forced to compete with the rates Disney set, even though the company has diligently added new top-tier sports events and movies to its own streaming hub, Peacock. Warner Bros. Discovery, which has resisted the call to reduce CPMs significantly for its Max streaming service in tandem with Disney, is making less headway with buyers so far, according to executives familiar with market discussions. Meanwhile, Amazon and Netflix, both of which are eager to create new lines of ad revenue for their streaming services, are also facing headwinds, according to executives. These people say the two digital giants have sought more aggressive CPM rates than their TV competitors, but have found less traction, other than for Amazon’s “Thursday Night Football.” Disney and NBCUniversal are said to have moved the farthest with advertisers in the current market, along with Fox, which relies primarily on a wide swath of sports content — including next year’s Super Bowl — and has reduced its dependence on traditional entertainment shows in primetime. One person familiar with discussions says Fox has already sold a significant portion of commercial time for the first half of next year’s Big Game. No matter how much money Disney, NBC and Fox take away from rivals, people familiar with the market project that overall volume with be down, particularly in those areas that have lost ground due to streaming. Cable networks and primetime broadcast are expected to see downturns in the amount of upfront ad commitments secured. And despite the fact that 2024 is a presidential election year, some buyers suggest news programming is also facing new pressures. Some pharmaceutical manufacturers, typically strong supporters of news programming, are holding their purse-strings tighter. Meanwhile, many other advertisers would rather run their commercials in media environments that are less polarizing or contentious, a continuation of a recent trend. This upfront marks the second consecutive one in which the networks have agreed to rollbacks. Ad commitments in last year’s upfront market for primetime broadcast TV fell 3%, to $9.595 billion, compared with $9.91 billion in 2022, according to Media Dynamics Inc., an advertising consultancy that tracks the market. Cable TV saw even worse erosion, with advertisers committing $9.52 billion for primetime, down 7% compared to the $10.23 billion in commitments secured in 2022."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strategy & Miscellaneous News -> General News & Strategy"}]}

To maintain her privacy, Lacey skillfully controls her narrative, showing fans and paparazzi what she wants them to see. But when Lacey discovers her boyfriend is hiding two devastating secrets—a bad cocaine habit and a pregnant girlfriend—she begins to lose confidence and control of her own story. Then big-shouldered baseball player Jimmy Hodges, a former Rookie of the Year when Lacey was in high school, walks into the bar where she is venting to a friend. With his shaggy beard and unfashionable button-down, Jimmy is the opposite of the picture-perfect guy Lacey thinks she wants. Soon, sparks fly, and inhibitions go out the window when Lacey dares to take some chances. Lacey and Jimmy are polar opposites. But could this be the forever after they both need?” No writer or network/streaming service is currently attached to the project. Popular on Variety “I couldn’t be more thrilled to work with the team at UCP to bring Heavy Hitter to the screen, said Cotugno. “From our very first conversation, collaborative creative spirit was in the air.” “Heavy Hitter” was published in August 2024. It is Cotugno’s latest work, as she has published more than a dozen novels to date. Her other works include “Liar’s Beach,” “You Say It First,” “Meet the Benedettos,” and “Birds of California.” She is repped by WME and Sterling Lord Literistic, Inc.

He’ll replace Scott Stuber, who previously announced he’d be stepping down from the streaming behemoth in March. Lin’s name had been in the mix — along with recently departed Disney executive Sean Bailey, former Universal chief Stacey Snider and others — since the top film job opened in January. Lin is best known for producing the “Lego” film franchise, director Andy Muschietti’s adaptation of Stephen King’s horror novel “It,” and Disney’s “Aladdin” remake through his production company Rideback. He and Netflix previously worked together on “The Two Popes” and the live-action “Avatar: The Last Airbender” series. He will begin on April 1 and report to Bela Bajaria, Netflix’s chief content officer. Popular on Variety Prior to founding Rideback, Lin worked at Warner Bros. as as senior VP of production. During his eight-year tenure at the studio, from 1999 to 2007, he oversaw the development and production of major motion pictures such as Martin Scorsese’s “The Departed.” Last summer, he was in the ring to oversee DC Studios for Warner Bros. (before James Gunn and Peter Safran landed the gig). But those talks fell through because he wasn’t ready to part ways with Rideback. With the new job, however, he’s leaving the company and handing the reins of Rideback to the new co-CEOs, Jonathan Eirich and Michael LoFaso. “While I’ve been approached many times during my past 15 years at Rideback, I could truly never imagine leaving until Bela reached out with this incredible opportunity,” Lin said in a statement. “It’s always been my aspiration at Rideback to make movies with worldwide appeal and universal themes, and there is no better place to do that than at the company with the widest global audience. It’s an incredible opportunity that I couldn’t say no to.” Lin’s hiring fills one of the most influential jobs in movies. It’s not clear how he plans to shake up Netflix’s film strategy, which has newly shifted away from being a volume business. Unlike Stuber’s early days at the streamer, the executive’s final stretch was largely defined by a desire to focus on quality over quantity. Will Lin’s priority be to finally land that elusive best picture Oscar for Netflix? Or is he more interested in making popcorn fare for general audiences, like he did at Rideback? “Dan’s experience as both an executive and a producer is marked by a consistent ability to draw in exceptional filmmakers,” Bajaria said. “But what really got my attention was his creation of Rideback, a dynamic community for filmmakers, fostering collaborative and creative environments. His visionary approach has led to the establishment of incubators and residencies, propelling the careers of extraordinary talent, as well as a steady slate of blockbuster films.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Org -> Exec Changes"}]}

U.S. District Judge Edward Davila on Tuesday rebuffed arguments to dismiss the lawsuit, finding that the company could’ve leveraged its purchase of Hulu to raise prices of live TV streamed over the internet across the market. Disney may have imposed anticompetitive terms on rivals, including AT&T’s DirectTV and Dish’s Sling TV, by forcing them to carry ESPN as part of the cheapest bundle they offer and instituting so-called most favored nation clauses, which ensure that ESPN affiliate fees negotiated with any given competitor represent an industrywide price floor, the court concluded. Related Stories YouTube TV subscribers suing Disney, however, were barred from seeking damages on federal antitrust claims in the case. On those claims, they’re now limited to seeking a court order to block further violations of antitrust law. They can also still recover money for violations of state competition and consumer protection laws. As recently as 2013, more than 90 percent of households in the U.S. subscribed to cable to satellite TV packages. That figure cratered with the rise of streaming platforms. Starting with HBO in 2014 offering a subscription to its catalogue entirely over the internet, formerly cable-only services began to debundle their content from cable and satellite TV plans, which has since lost its status as a gatekeeper for must-see film and TV shows. Following the industry-disrupting decoupling of content, 2015 saw the birth of what would become virtual multichannel video programming distributors when Dish-owned Sling TV offered subscribers the ability to watch a subset of traditional cable channels without a cable subscription. Other similarly-situated companies, including AT&T, Google and YouTube, subsequently entered the market with streaming live pay TV (SLPTV) options. In 2022, YouTube TV subscribers sued Disney over allegations that the company inflated the prices for live TV streamed over the internet. The crux of the case lies in Disney’s control of a highly desired channel in ESPN and an SLPTV in Hulu and whether the entertainment giant negotiated anticompetitive carriage agreements for ESPN, raising subscriptions prices across the market. The complaint, which seeks to represent roughly five million YouTube TV subscribers, claimed a violation of the Sherman Act pertaining to unreasonable restraints of trade and various state competition and consumer protection laws. Disney’s defense was multipronged. Among the main arguments it pressed was that the imposition of allegedly anticompetitive contractual terms harms SLPTV providers rather than consumers. Judge Davila disagreed. While the carriage agreements at issue in the case are between ESPN and the SLPTV, the lawsuit properly alleges that Disney leverages the deals “and its control of Hulu” to suppress competition, with the aim of selling subscription packages to consumers, he found. The court pointed to allegations that Disney, from the moment it obtained control over Hulu, “raised prices with impunity — as well as the primary cost input of its competitors” in ESPN. The first major carriage agreement negotiation Disney faced after taking control of Hulu was with AT&T’s DirecTV, which offered a rival streaming live TV offering over the internet called AT&T TV Now. As the existing deal approached expiration, Disney warned DirecTV subscribers that they’d lose access to ESPN and other channels it owned. On a Monday Night Football broadcast, then the most-watched show on cable, it said, “[S]o far AT&T has refused to reach a fair, market-based agreement with us, despite the fact that the terms we are seeking are in line with recent marketplace deals we have reached with other distributors.” AT&T capitulated five days later, forcing it to raise the price of its live TV streaming service base package by $15. Through the carriage deal with AT&T, the lawsuit argued that Disney “not only ensured that AT&T/DirecTV Now could not undercut Hulu + Live TV on price, it ensured that its rival AT&T’s costs were high enough for streaming live TV programming that AT&T/DirecTV Now had to push its base price, which had to include ESPN, well above Hulu + Live TV’s price.” The court concluded that Disney may have imposed terms on rivals, which force them to carry ESPN as part of the cheapest bundle they offer and ensure that ESPN affiliate fees negotiated with any given competitor represent an industrywide price floor, “without suffering from price competition.” But YouTube TV subscribers will not be able to seek damages on the antitrust claims, which allow for treble damages, after Davila found that they weren’t directly harmed by the allegedly anticompetitive conduct. The lawsuit “does not allege that Plaintiffs purchased SLPTV subscription packages from a member of a conspiracy, but rather from a victim of Disney’s anticompetitive conduct,” he wrote. They may be able to recover damages if they prevail on alleged violations of state competition and consumer protection laws. Disney didn’t respond to a request for comment. Amid Hollywood’s dual strikes last year, a brighter spotlight was put on Disney’s role as a content supplier and distributor. The Writers Guild of America issued a report warning of over-consolidation in Hollywood. It said Disney’s series of mergers — with Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and others — led to price hikes for its streaming services, further vertically integrated the company, pushed creatives to give up revenue from future licensing of their TV content and “reduced output and innovation,” per the report. Dozens of writers wrote to the Federal Trade Commission in support of revisions to draft merger guidelines that allow courts to take into consideration a merger’s impact on labor.

The case stemmed from a series of ABC News reports in 2012 fronted by star anchor Diane Sawyer that dubbed the processed meat “pink slime.” At the time, it marked the largest settlement or jury award ever for a libel case and has since been eclipsed only by Alex Jones ($1.438 billion to Sandy Hook families) and Fox News ($787.5 million to Dominion Voting Systems). Fast forward to 2024, and George Stephanopoulos is now the face of ABC News and one of the highest-paid anchors on TV, making up to $18 million per year. And inside Disney’s C-suites on the Burbank lot, there was a feeling of déjà vu thanks to a looming defamation lawsuit filed in March by former and incoming President Donald Trump, a far more powerful and strident adversary than a South Dakota food processor. But a protracted fight with the president elect was similarly unpredictable and potentially devastating. Popular on Variety Says a source familiar with the inner workings of ABC: “This was ‘Pink Slime II: The Sequel.’” In a move that floored ABC News’ rank-and-file journalists inside the network and in the broader journalistic community, Disney CEO Bob Iger authorized a $15 million settlement and an additional $1 million to cover Trump’s legal fees as well as a quasi-apology on Dec. 13. According to sources, Stephanopoulos was blindsided, unaware that Disney would back down in such a public manner until a few hours before the news broke. (Disney and Stephanopoulos declined comment.) As CEO, Iger had long been a champion of Stephanopoulos, despite the anchor’s wonkier tendencies as “GMA” has needed to lean more heavily on pop culture and celebrity for ratings. (The morning show averaged 2.69 million viewers last week, behind “Today’s” 2.83 million average.) When Stephanopoulos started to float the idea in 2020 that he might leave ABC as his four-year contract was about to expire, Iger directly helped steer the negotiations to keep him in the fold — giving the anchor a new lucrative deal that also allowed him to produce documentaries for Hulu such as “Pretty Baby.” But with Stephanopoulos’ current deal up in early 2025, insiders at ABC aren’t sure if he will stay at the network given the recent turn of events. Sources say Stephanopoulos has been vocal about how unhappy he has been with the settlement and apology. For ABC, the economics of paying an anchor $18 million a year may not make sense as “GMA” isn’t the advertising cash cow it once was. (Hoda Kotb recently announced her departure as a full-time anchor on “Today” after NBC tried to slash her salary.) Trump’s decision to sue ABC News and the settlement offer a window into just what the future might hold for journalists in his second term. “We’re aghast,” says one entrenched media executive with oversight of network TV news. “This is capitulation, but it’s also payback for how sloppy the press has been. We should have been more buttoned up and ready for this.” For observers who monitor First Amendment issues, the settlement will have a chilling effect. “It sends a message to be quiet,” says Katie Blankenship, senior director at PEN America, which advocates for free speech. “It sends a message to err on the side of caution.” In a statement, Society Professional Journalists executive director Caroline Hendrie said she “is concerned that the largely unexplained decision to settle the case risks setting a troubling precedent about the willingness of news organizations to defend their journalists in court.” But Disney faced major hurdles with the lawsuit that stemmed from the anchor’s comments made on air that falsely claimed, “Donald Trump has been found liable for rape by a jury.” (In fact, a jury’s verdict found Trump liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s.) Stephanopoulos repeated the error 10 times during a March broadcast on “This Week,” the Sunday news program that he hosts. Stephanopoulos isn’t the only high-profile person to use the word “rape.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called Trump “an adjudicated rapist” during an interview with Jen Psaki on MSNBC as did Rep. Jamie Raskin while speaking with Dana Bash on CNN. Actor Bradley Whitford used that exact phrase during a rally for Kamala Harris in Wisconsin in October. But ABC News is held to the highest journalistic standards and an anchor’s lapse is different than a guest’s, making Stephanopoulos an easy target. Still, many are perplexed by why Disney folded so early in the legal process. In July, a federal Florida judge ruled against Disney’s bid to toss Trump’s suit, allowing for it to move forward. But the case was not yet guaranteed to go to a trial, when the real expenses of litigation kick in. As such, the settlement sent “shockwaves” through the media law community, says Katie Townsend, the legal director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. “It’s candidly pretty troubling,” she says. “The concern is — particularly given the timing and the nature of the settlement — that it will encourage and embolden President Trump and people in his circle to pursue even more of these types of not just litigation, but threats of litigation.” Townsend said she was surprised that ABC did not pursue the case through the discovery process to a ruling on summary judgment. (The network did just that in the “pink slime” case as did Fox News in its battle against Dominion, with the latter opening up the network to embarrassing emails and text messages indicating bias that were collected during the discovery process.) Chad Milton, a media consultant who specializes in liability insurance, said he also found it a little surprising that ABC did not pursue its viable legal defenses. ABC could have argued both that Stephanopoulos’ characterization was “substantially true,” and that he did not act with “actual malice” — that is, a willful disregard of the truth. “I’ve heard the chatter that people think this is a capitulation to Trump,” Milton said. “Sometimes business considerations will be factors. The bigger the business, the more entangled it is.” Some believe the case was winnable for the network. “I felt from the beginning that ABC and George Stephanopoulos had extremely strong arguments to defeat this lawsuit,” says Ted Boutrous, a First Amendment lawyer who fought the first Trump administration over press access. “There were multiple legal and constitutional defenses that put them in a very strong position.” Boutrous predicts that the settlement will have a “ripple effect across the journalistic landscape” and gives Trump “a green light to bring other lawsuits.” Others believe that a settlement now — one month before Trump takes office for a second term — was the best option. Disney, which reported $88 billion in global revenue in 2023, didn’t want to start off 2025 in a protracted fight with Trump, who could have continually trashed the company’s movies, TV shows, amusement parks and merchandise to the 77 million Americans who voted for him from his perch of the highest office in the land. Gregory Doll, an attorney at Doll Amir & Eley in Los Angeles, calls Disney’s move “just smart business.” He adds: “This was just going to be a cloud hanging over them. ABC News is going to want to have interviews with [Trump’s] cabinet and other officials.” Furthermore, Disney is already locked in battle with billionaire Elon Musk, who has been tapped to lead Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” with Vivek Ramaswamy. Musk is backing actress Gina Carano in a lawsuit against Disney for her firing from the series “The Mandalorian” over social media posts deemed offensive by the company. Disney stopped short of waging multiple battles with Trump and his closest associates. But Townsend argued ABC’s motivations are less important than the ultimate effect the litigation could have on others. She said politicians have already been misusing the legal system to go after their critics. “I don’t see any signals that that’s slowing,” she said. “We can anticipate that’s probably going to increase.” Case in point: In the immediate aftermath of the settlement, Trump filed a civil lawsuit against the Des Moines Register for publishing J. Ann Selzer’s poll days before the election that showed Harris leading Trump in the state by three points, citing a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Trump would go on to win Iowa by 13 points. As one of the biggest corporations in the world, Disney is capitalized well enough to cover $16 million and face a few days of bad press. After all, the company reached a $233 million settlement this week in a class action lawsuit about wages, an issue that also has put Disney in a negative light, with everyone from progressive politicians to heiress Abigail Disney slamming the company for its labor practices.

The new iteration of the influential document does not really reflect any fundamental changes to the company’s core principles. The new title is “Netflix Culture — The Best Work of Our Lives,” whereas most recently it was titled “Netflix Culture — Seeking Excellence.” One of the most noticeable changes: Netflix has replaced the “Freedom and Responsibility” heading and now incorporates those principles under a section called “People Over Process.” However, the principle that Netflix still lets employees act on their own initiative without a lot of red tape is still embodied in the doc. The new iteration puts an “emphasis on responsibility, and the focus on good and bad process versus no process at all,” chief talent officer Sergio Ezama wrote in a blog post about the new version of the culture memo. Popular on Variety Netflix continues to not have officially outlined expenses or vacation policies. The company’s vacation policy is two words: “Take vacation.” And the expenses policy is five words: “Act in Netflix’s best interests.” “You might think that this kind of freedom leads to chaos,” Ezama noted. “While we’ve had our fair share of failures — and a few people have taken advantage of our culture — our emphasis on individual autonomy has created a very successful business.” Netflix’s new culture memo includes these two items as among its four core principles (alongside “The Dream Team” and “People Over Process” entries): - Uncomfortably Exciting: To entertain the world, we need to be bold and ambitious. That means embracing the thrill of what’s next — even when it’s uncomfortable. - Great and Always Better: We often say Netflix sucks today compared to where we can be tomorrow. We need the self-awareness to understand what should be better, and the discipline and resilience to get there. Meanwhile, it still includes Netflix’s notorious “Keeper Test,” which encourages managers to dismiss staffers if the answer to the question is, “If X wanted to leave, would I fight to keep them?” is “No.” But the new version softens the language a bit: “In the abstract, the keeper test can sound scary. In reality, we encourage everyone to speak to their managers about what’s going well and what’s not on a regular basis. This helps avoid surprises,” the updated version says. The updated Netflix culture memo is shorter: It clocks in at 2,264 words, down from more than 3,800 in the most recent version. “We’ve shortened it by focusing on what’s most important, and what differentiates Netflix,” according to Ezama. Co-cofounder Reed Hastings introduced the original 125-page Netflix culture slide deck in August 2009. Since then, Netflix has revised the document four times. The latest version has been “12 months in the making, with every employee given the chance to weigh in,” according to Ezama. In total, Netflix staffers submitted more than 1,500 comments. “We believe that our culture is key to our success and so we want to ensure that anyone applying for a job here knows what motivates Netflix — and all employees are working from a shared understanding of what we value most,” Ezama wrote.

FX has given a series order to The Beauty, a drama starring Evan Peters, Anthony Ramos, Jeremy Pope and Ashton Kutcher. Peters, Ramos and Pope also executive produce. Co-created, written and exec produced by Murphy and Matt Hodgson, The Beauty is based on the comic books by Jeremy Haun and Jason A. Hurley. Production on the 11-episode first season is slated to begin this fall, likely in November. Per usual for a Ryan Murphy project, no official details about the premise and the characters are provided. The 2016 graphic novel The Beauty is about an STD that makes those affected beautiful. But the disease, dubbed “the Beauty,” eventually kills its hosts as part of a suspected sinister government plot. The main characters in the comics are detectives Drew Foster and Kara Vaughn, partners on beauty crime cases who have to find their way past corrupt politicians, vengeful federal agents, and a terrifying mercenary out to collect the price on their heads. Watch on Deadline I hear the TV series adaptation also is a two-hander, with a male and female lead. Search is under way for an actress to join Peters, Ramos, Pope and Kutcher, so it’s possible that she and one of the four, likely Peters, could play Vaughn and Foster, respectively. Kutcher is thought to be playing a tech billionaire. Chatter about The Beauty first started in June, with Murphy’s frequent collaborator Peters said to be attached as star and executive producer. By August, the cast started to take shape with Ramos, Pope and Kutcher either set or in negotiations. Kutcher’s involvement in the series predates the recent arrest and indictment of Sean “Diddy” Combs on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering that has put a spotlight on people who have had a longtime relationship with him. The Beauty is executive produced by Murphy, Hodgson, Peters, Ramos, Pope, Alexis Martin Woodall, Eric Kovtun, Scott Robertson, Nissa Diederich and Eric Gitter. The series is produced by 20th Television in association with Ryan Murphy Television. Peters headlined and executive produced Murphy’s hit Netflix limited series Dahmer: Monster – The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, for which he earned an Emmy nomination, a SAG nomination and a Golden Globe. An Emmy winner for HBO’s Mare of Easttown, Peters appeared in nine installments of Murphy’s FX anthology series American Horror Story, receiving a producer credit for the 10th. Other series credits include Disney+’s WandaVision and FX’s Pose. He next stars in Tron: Ares. Peters is repped by CAA and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.

The multi-parter is expected to have Papini for the first time explain her sudden vanishing while out for a morning run in her close-knit California community. That triggered a three-week search by her family and local authorities that made global headlines, before Papini was found on the side of a road, bruised and distraught.

We are at a really important time at ESPN right now. Incredibly important. And it’s not just about Flagship” – the internal name for the 2025 launch of ESPN’s full-scale streaming service – “but Flagship is probably the most important new initiative that we are going to be launching and I’m incredibly excited to be a part of it.” The exec delivered his comments in a sit-down at the start of an ESPN Media Day at its Bristol, CT headquarters. After an initial exchange with communications chief Josh Krulewitz, the session moved into an open Q&A period with reporters. Along with succession and streaming, topics included innovation, employee morale and relationships with leagues. Watch on Deadline Pitato is one of four internal candidates who have been mentioned as potential successor, along with entertainment co-chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman and parks chief Josh D’Amaro. Iger’s current contract runs through the end of 2026 and he has repeatedly pledged to exit as planned. Pitaro, who has a background in technology including an exec stint at Yahoo, outlined tech-related plans for Flagship (which, he clarified, will not actually be called Flagship but will have a name to be announced). It will have a number of enhanced features for fantasy sports and betting. “We know that it can’t just be as simple as flipping a switch,” he said. “We know that our product needs to be enhanced.” To that end, he added, “it’s all hands on deck.” After operating ESPN+ over the past six years, Pitaro said, “We are ready for the next step.” The forthcoming ESPN service will cost between $11.99 (the price of ESPN+) and a full pay-TV package and the company sees “a lot of opportunity in the middle” of those two points. One element of the flagship service will be regional sports and local games. On the business front, there is a bigger opportunity now for ESPN given the collapse of the regional sports network model and the descent of top player Diamond Sports (which operates Bally Sports) into bankruptcy. “We very much believe that Flagship should be part of the solution,” Pitaro said. “If you’re part of the ESPN environment, we can geotarget you, recognize where you are and serve you local, in-market game.” Leagues and teams have been anxious about the deterioration of RSNs, with many of them exploring free, over-the-air broadcast and looking to enhance its streaming offerings. ESPN has looked to extend its capabilities as a potential solution, Pitaro said. “We’ve made that point to various leagues and commissioners that we are very interested in stepping up,” he said. “It doesn’t necessarily have to be in connection with Flagship. It can be an upsell as part of Flagship. We can make these games available in the ESPN app.” The exec also extolled the virtues of AI. “We see this as nothing but positive for a sports fan and for the business,” he said. By the time the flagship ESPN streaming service launches, he said, AI tools will be able to deliver a personalized version of SportsCenter to individual viewers based on their preferences."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Sports -> General News & Strategy"}]}

The strong buy-in from advertisers follows a move last January by Prime Video to start running ads on all film and TV titles in the U.S. and nine other countries, except for subscribers willing to pay extra to avoid ads. The streaming service hosted its first upfront event in New York during the traditional mid-May corridor alongside traditional broadcast network parents and tech rivals Netflix and YouTube. Along with the promotional push and hefty programming budget, the company has also reportedly been willing to price their ad inventory more attractively in order to stimulate demand as it ramps up its sales efforts. The Information reported earlier Thursday on the upfront results. Watch on Deadline An Amazon rep declined to comment on the report when contacted by Deadline. In recent years, Amazon has made video advertising a pillar of its broader corporate strategy, pursuing major sports rights as a key element of its ad-friendly programming. The company is in its third year of exclusive NFL Thursday Night Football streams and will begin an 11-year agreement with the NBA in the 2025-26 season. Along with those offerings on Prime Video, Amazon also operates the FAST service Freevee as well as gamer-centric livestreaming platform Twitch and has highlighted them for advertisers in recent years. The overall streaming sector has shifted toward ads over the past two years after a longtime initial phase when it was viewed as de facto ad-free and subscription-driven medium. Along with new ad tiers coming to Netflix and other outlets, FAST services have become a large and growing part of the landscape, especially for traditional players looking to replace declining linear ad revenue. A survey this week from research firm eMarketer said that five streamers would book at least $1 billion in ad revenue during 2024, up from just two in 2020. Amazon ranked third on eMarketer’s list, after Hulu and YouTube, with an estimated $3.13 billion. In his annual letter to shareholders released last April, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy mentioned the ad push and estimated the company’s overall reach at 200 million monthly viewers. “Streaming TV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start,” he wrote. Netflix Co-CEO Greg Peters was asked about the competitive streaming ad landscape during an appearance last week at the FT Business of Entertainment Summit. “Amazon came into the market in a pretty strong way,” he said. “We came with the thesis that advertising is an option” that would appeal to certain consumers at its $6.99-a-month price point. Amazon, by contrast, “is an advertising company. It is a core part of their DNA. .... Very much like Amazon does, they sort of came at it and said – what’s their mantra, ‘Your margin is my opportunity,’ I think, right? They came in said, ‘We’re going to go drop to the bottom, essentially, and start to compete from that basis.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Investor Relations -> General News & Strategy -> Quarterly Earnings"}]}

Robert Oppenheimer and M3GAN, Universal Pictures ranked as the highest-grossing studio at the 2023 box office. The company’s slate — a range of 24 films that included “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” “Oppenheimer” and “M3GAN” — collected $4.907 billion in worldwide ticket sales. Universal’s victory is notable because it marks the first time since 2015 that Disney was not the global box office leader. Disney slid to second place in terms of market share as its 17 new films, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” and “The Little Mermaid” among them, raked in $4.827 billion globally. In a note to press, the studio partially attributed the $80 million difference to the fact that Disney released seven fewer movies than Universal in 2023. It also went on to stress that Disney had the most titles of any studio in the top 10 this year, with four of the highest-grossing global releases and three of the biggest domestic releases. Popular on Variety But for the first time in a long time, Disney didn’t have one of the top three movies — those spots belong to Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” ($1.4 billion) and Universal’s “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($1.3 billion) and “Oppenheimer” ($950 million). It’s also the first time since 2014 (except for the pandemic-stricken 2020 and 2021) that none of Disney’s movies crossed the $1 billion benchmark. Disney indeed remains a box office powerhouse, but the reality is that most of the studio’s 2023 tentpoles failed to live up to expectations. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” ($845 million) was the only clear triumph. Otherwise, a string of underperforming sequels and remakes (“Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” “The Marvels” and “Haunted Mansion,” to name a few) resulted in the studio ceding the box office crown to Universal. It should be noted that many of Disney’s modest wins or even outright flops would be classified as smash successes for its rivals. The problem is that Disney movies are hugely expensive — typically carrying production budgets of $200 million to $250 million — so they have high bars to clear in terms of profitability. So while “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” ranked as the 10th-highest grossing movie of the year with $476 million, it still ended up losing money for the studio in its theatrical run. Universal endured a few misfires as well, but none were as painful. The vampire comedy “Renfield” limped to $26 million globally, “Book Club: The Next Chapter” failed to reach $30 million worldwide (the first film hit $100 million in 2018) and the animated “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” barely hit $45 million. Although “Fast X” cost $340 million and barely broke even, the film grossed $704 million, enough to stand as the fifth-biggest movie of the year. While Universal and Disney were closely gunning for No. 1, they were punching far above the rest. Warner Bros. landed in a distant third place with $3.84 billion globally — led by “Barbie,” “The Nun II” and “Wonka.” With “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” the Denzel Washington threequel “Equalizer 3” and Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” among its 2023 lineup, Sony trailed at No. 4 with $2.094 billion worldwide.

We can reveal the streamer has ordered a fourth season of the Hindi-language series, which is from Applause Entertainment and was originally based on the 2008 BBC series of the same name. Peter Moffat’s British show went to two seasons, but Gaurav Banerjee, Disney+ Hotstar’s Head of Content for Disney+ Hotstar and HSM Entertainment Networks, Disney Star, and his team have now taken the Indian show well beyond that point. You can watch a teaser trailer for the fourth season here. “This is a pretty special moment because it marks five years of the Hotstar Specials journey, which launched in 2019,” he said. “Criminal Justice was our first big fiction series, and it is fantastic to see the franchise become stronger and continue to get critical acclaim and consumer love.” Pankaj Tripathi will return as lawyer Madhav Mishra in a new story, though other casting details are remaining under wraps. Banerjee said a “large part” of the shoot is completed and that “lots of the original characters will come back.” Furthermore, it will feature “some powerhouse casting who have been part of the world before.” Banerjee said the season would reinforce the evolution of the Mishra character, who called the “anchor” of the show. “Everyone wants to root for him, and you can always trust him to finally do the right thing,” he added. Rohan Sippy will direct, with Applause making the show in association with BBC Studios, which owns the rights to the scripted format. No airdate has been set, but Disney+ Hotstar said it would be “soon.” Season one of the show launched in 2019, starring the likes of Tripathi, Vikrant Massey, Jackie Shroff and Anupriya Goenka. It followed a similar plot line to the BBC show, which starred Ben Whishaw as a man accused of murder after a drunken night out. Season two, dubbed Criminal Justice: Behind Closed Doors and launched in December 2020, focused on a murder within a family, while season three, Criminal Justice: Adhura Sach followed the murder of a teenage celebrity. ‘The biggest stars to come out of Indian streaming” Banerjee praised Disney+ Hotstar’s partnership with the BBC, saying the British content giant had allowed Applause CEO Sameer Nair and the writing team the “freedom” to follow their vision and make the series “completely Indian.” The series has turned Tripathi and Massey into “the biggest stars to come out of the streaming world in India,” and been a trigger for numerous scripted shows that have followed on Disney+ Hotstar, he added. Indeed, Tripathi and Massey have broken out into film, with the former nominated for a Filmfare award for Best Actor for his role in 2023 comedy-drama OMG 2 and the latter winning the same category this year for biographical drama 12th Fail. “It is hard to underestimate what Criminal Justice has done for our brand, for Applause, the lead actors, and the incredibly talented writers and directors,” said Banerjee. “When you try something on a big scale with such complexity, it might not be an easy watch and you are taking a risk – and Criminal Justice is far from what a conventional TV show in India is. When that pays off and you get consumer love, you are emboldened. Criminal Justice has been followed by shows such as Special Ops, Aarya, The Night Manager and The Freelancer — all with great, highly ambitious and sometimes morally ambiguous storytelling.” Though most of its shows are, like Criminal Justice, produced in the Hindi language, Disney+ Hotstar has been pushing into high-profile, event-style TV in languages such as Tamil and Malayalam over the past years, with around ten now going to multiple seasons. “In many ways, that all started with Criminal Justice,” said Banerjee. Besides the Indian and UK versions of Criminal Justice, HBO ran an acclaimed 2016 version starring Riz Ahmed, which won him a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series of Movie, with John Turturro nominated in the same category. There have also been French and Korea remakes, for now-defunct streaming service Salto and Coupang Play, respectively. India’s fourth season recommission comes at an interesting time for Disney+ Hotstar, whose parent Disney India is in the process of forming a joint venture with manufacturing giant Reliance Industries’ entertainment wing — a deal that would place the streamer in the same stable as its biggest competition, JioCinema. Data last year out of India suggested JioCinema was in position to overtake Disney+ Hotstar in total numbers after bagging the streaming rights to the Indian Premier League cricket and several U.S. content deals. However, Disney’s service remains top of the subscription pile. Banerjee declined to comment on the corporate wrangling, and instead responded beyond saying: “Me and my team have an excellent strategy and have everything we need from resourcing point of view.” Addressing the wider Indian streaming market, Banerjee said it was “natural for there to be more competition,” with the likes of Netflix and Prime Video putting India front and center of their international expansion plans, and local players wanting a piece of the giant entertainment sector. “We built out a market that is growing at a phenomenal rate,” he added. “India is in an incredible position — it is the most populous country in the world, with limitless potential and a consumption increase that is unparalleled. It’s natural for all global companies to have India at the top of their growth agendas. We welcome the competition — it helps us to finesse our offer and we remain the leader of SVOD in every which way.” To accent the latter point, Banerjee pointed to the popularity of long-running talk show Koffee With Karan as one example of how the streamer has built fanbases, along with the multiple language versions of Bigg Boss, the Indian version of Big Brother that also play on the Star linear channels. He also noted how it has launched new talent through series such as Taaza Khabar, built out a ‘spy universe’ through the Special Ops thriller brand and push hard into animation through the likes of The Legend of Hanuman, whose fourth season launched last month. Banerjee noted there was a gap in the sitcom space on the streamer and was assessing how the expand Criminal Justice further.

Amazon has ordered a reboot of the classic competition series for its Prime Video service. The series is produced by MGM Alternative and Amazon MGM Studios for Prime Video in association with Flor-Jon Films, the production company from American Gladiators series creator Johnny C. Ferraro, who exec produces. American Gladiators is considered one of the first reality competition series. It pitted a cast of amateur athletes against each other as well as the shows’ own gladiators across a range of challenges including a tough obstacle course. The new series includes classic competitions such as Gauntlet, Hang Tough, and, of course The Eliminator. Watch on Deadline The move comes as the format has been rejuvenated across the pond where British broadcaster BBC has found success with a new generation of Gladiators. That version has become its biggest entertainment series launch in nearly a decade and was quickly renewed for a second season. American Gladiators originally launched in syndication and aired weekly between 1989 and 1996. The series was created by Johnny C. Ferraro after he and Dan Carr came up with the original concept for the competition event. The show was rebooted by NBC in 2008 – during that year’s writers strike – with Hulk Hogan and Laila Ali hosting. It ran for two seasons and was produced by MGM Television and Reveille. There have been multiple attempts to bring back to screens since. American Ninja Warrior producer A. Smith & Co. was developing a new take on the format in 2014 that never made it to air. Similarly, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg tried again in 2018, teaming up with MGM to bring it back for its 30th anniversary, without any joy. Deadline revealed in 2021 that MGM had teamed with the WWE to bring it back in 2021. Last year, there was a wave of nostalgia, in documentary form, around the brand as both ESPN and Netflix aired documentaries about the brand. The Disney-owned sports network aired 30 For 30: The American Gladiators Documentary, while Netflix launched Muscles & Mayhem: An Unauthorized Story of American Gladiators. Earlier this year, Ferraro signed with Range Sports to help him bring it back to screens. At the time, the management company said that it had plans to exploit the brand across TV, film, attractions, merchandising and live events. Amazon itself has been trying to ramp up its unscripted offerings on its Prime Video and Freevee services. It recently launched a U.S. version of British game show The 1% Club, hosted by Patton Oswalt, and premiered reality competition The Goat, hosted by Daniel Tosh. It is now casting the series. “Gladiators is an enduring, physical challenge format that continues to engage families around the world,” said Lauren Anderson, head, Brand and Content Innovation, Amazon MGM Studios. “We look forward to delighting our global Prime Video customers with both reimagined and nostalgic elements that celebrate the best of the original series.” “Doing a cross-country casting search is exciting for us, and for the fans. Our goal is to find a real cross-section of America’s fittest and fiercest competitors.

In addition, Glover recently announced that he will go on a world tour as Childish Gambino beginning in August through February 2025. Amazon declined to comment on whether or not Glover and Erskine would return. Reps for Glover and Erskine did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment. Popular on Variety “We are excited to announce that a second season of our groundbreaking spy series, ‘Mr. and Mrs. Smith,’ is in the works for our global Prime Video customers,” said Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios. “The success of the first season, with its incredibly modern, sexy reinvention of the original film, is a testament to the brilliant creators Donald Glover and Francesa Sloane. We are proud to bring you another season filled with unforgettable journeys and new adventures.” Given the bloody Season 1 ending, it’s not altogether surprising that Glover and Erskine would not be featured in a second season. Instead, the show could go the anthology route and feature a new couple in Season 2 who take up the names Jane and John Smith, just as Glover and Erskine’s characters did in the beginning of the series. The announcement was made as part of Amazon’s first ever upfront presentation to advertisers in New York on Tuesday. “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” is a reimagining of the 2005 film that starred Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The series is produced by New Regency and Amazon MGM Studios. Per the official series description: “In the first season of ‘Mr. & Mrs. Smith,’ two lonely strangers land jobs working for a mysterious spy agency that offers them a glorious life of espionage, wealth, world travels, and a dream brownstone in Manhattan. The catch? New identities in an arranged marriage as Mr. and Mrs. John and Jane Smith. Now hitched, John and Jane navigate a high-risk mission every week while also facing a new relationship milestone. Their complex cover story becomes even more complicated when they catch real feelings for each other. What’s riskier: espionage or marriage?” The show received critical acclaim upon its release in February, with the first season holding a 90% critical approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In her review for Variety, Alison Herman wrote, “With a few extra hours of runtime, ‘Mr. & Mrs. Smith’ builds John, Jane and their relationship into something worth caring about.

Discovery has indicated early interest in exploring a partnership with Paramount Global to combine WBD’s Max and Paramount+, according to sources. Paramount Global, after its controlling shareholder Shari Redstone scrapped merger talks with Skydance Media last month, is proceeding under a new strategic plan under three co-CEOs to slash costs, explore the sale of certain assets and accelerate the profitability of Paramount+ via a possible joint venture with another player. One potential streaming dance partner for Paramount is Warner Bros. Discovery. A source confirmed WBD’s preliminary interest in evaluating a streaming JV with Paramount Global, as first reported by CNBC. Popular on Variety Of course, it’s not a surprise that Warner Bros. Discovery would at least look into the feasibility of a streaming JV with Paramount, given how public Paramount Global’s leadership team has been about their desire to land a partner. At this point, the situation more or less involves each company kicking the tires on what such a partnership could look like. Reps for Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global declined to comment. At Paramount Global’s June 25 employee town hall meeting, Chris McCarthy, one of the members of the three-headed Office of the CEO (and CEO of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks), discussed two potential streaming partnerships. The first option “is to enter a deep, long-term relationship with a leading technology platform, which already has the full scale that we are trying to obtain. But what they don’t have is our scale of content and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits,” McCarthy told employees at the town hall. “And this would allow us to focus a greater percent of our budget on the things we do best — that’s making hit content.” The second type of partnership Paramount Global is exploring “involves us joining forces with one or more other SVOD players,” McCarthy said. “The sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports and would attract millions of viewers. Plus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.” McCarthy said, “The great news is there is tremendous interest in partnering with us across both of these strategic options, given the strength of our content, the volume of our hits, and our industry-leading track record.” Separately, at a recent investment conference, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said the company will be “opportunistic” in seeking M&A deals in the next two or three years. Variety VIP+ Analysis: How Do You Solve a Problem Like Paramount+? “There are a lot of players that are losing a lot of money,” Zaslav said May 30 at the Bernstein 40th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference. “There’ll be some players that want to get out of the business, that will look to consolidate their streaming businesses with others,” he said, adding that he believes there will be four or five dominant global streaming platforms as things shake out. Paramount earlier this year discussed merging Paramount+ with NBCUniversal’s Peacock in the past, but so far nothing has transpired on that front. Meanwhile, late last year, Zaslav and Bob Bakish (then CEO of Paramount) briefly discussed the idea of merging WBD and Paramount Global but those talks did not go anywhere.

The initiative was revealed as part of Japanese electronics and entertainment conglomerate Sony Group Corporation’s annual corporate strategy presentation. “The launch of a project to establish an academy [comes] with the aim of nurturing anime creators in global markets, mainly by Aniplex and Crunchyroll with collaboration from across the industry,” said Sony Group chairman and CEO Yoshida Kenichiro and president, COO and CFO Totoki Hiroki. Anime is a significant and growing portion of Sony’s business, though it is split across different divisions. Aniplex which is a creator and distributor of Japanese animation is currently a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) which is part of the wider music division. It has enjoyed success with anime franchises such as “Demon Slayer.” Popular on Variety Specialist streaming service and anime distributor Crunchyroll, however, falls within Sony’s ‘pictures division,’ the business segment that includes the U.S.-based Sony Pictures Entertainment content production and distribution operations and Sony’s TV channels business. It was revealed earlier this year and confirmed at the Thursday strategy presentation that Crunchyroll now has some 13 million paying subscribers. That is a significant increase since the Crunchyroll business was acquired in 2021 from AT&T and merged with Sony’s Funimation. At the time the deal was announced most estimates pegged the two platforms’ subscriber total at around five million – with Crunchyroll having 4 million and Funimation between one and three million (before duplication). Sony chose to use Crunchyroll as the merged platform’s brand name and separate access to Funimation was finally phased out earlier in 2024. Sony says that it will develop anime in other ways too. These include improving the production environment, efficiency, and enhancing the quality of output through “AnimeCanvas,” a new animation production software currently under development. That points towards more computer graphics and use of AI in the Japanese industry, which has remained significantly dependent on traditional hand-drawn techniques, but which is also reported to be operating at full capacity. Sony said that A-1 Pictures and CloverWorks, production studios that are both subsidiaries of Aniplex, are central to this initiative and are collaborating with engineers from SMEJ and across the Sony Group. Sony is also putting more emphasis on the Crunchyroll Anime Awards, which foster anime IP and culture with fans and which celebrate anime creators. The awards received a record number of 34 million user votes in its 2024 edition. Calling the genre a “dynamic art form,” Crunchyroll president Rahul Purini, earlier this year said, “Anime is a powerful force, driving pop culture and connecting global fans.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strategy & Miscellaneous News -> General News & Strategy -> Strategy"}]}

That’s according to Carol Choi, Disney’s Executive Vice-President for APAC (ex-India), Original Content Strategy, who has spoken exclusively to Deadline about her plans for the streamer, which first launched in the region three years ago as part of the global Disney+ rollout. Since then, the streamer reset and Disney’s focus on profit over subs progress has changed Choi’s focus. “As the market and the Disney+ service continue to evolve, we continue to evaluate where we should focus our efforts and for the lack of a better term, get most bang out of our buck,” she said. “If you look at our Southeast Asia product offering, we’ve pivoted. It used to be a mass strategy, just to grab market share. Over the last three years since we launched, we’ve slowly increased our price to now become a more premium service, in order for us to continue to build up the base to what Disney+ is as a service.” Watch on Deadline Choi said Disney+ had “moved to a pricing level that matches the type of product that we’re offering” and that once it gets to “the next stage,” she will evaluate what sort of investment would continue to expand the subs base. “The last couple years were like an adjustment period and we’ve had some great results, so we know that there is demand for it. It’s just whether we have the business model that warrants it.” Choi was speaking to Deadline at the Disney APAC Content Showcase in Singapore, addressing topics such as originals, live sports programming and future Southeast Asia plans. During the event, Choi unveiled new Korean titles on the Disney+ slate, including The Murky Stream and The Manipulated and the streamer’s expansion into Japanese unscripted content, in collaboration with Nippon TV. Japanese anime projects such as BULLET/BULLET and Disney Twisted-Wonderland The Animation were on the upcoming Disney+ slate, highlighting how original titles from those two countries have remained core, while content has been reined in elsewhere. Indonesia was initially marked as a key growth market in Southeast Asia, with Disney+ producing originals such as Blood Curse and Tira under its Hotstar label. When asked about whether Disney+ will return to make an Indonesian original again, Choi was guarded, saying only, “It’s being examined. It’s under evaluation.” Successful examinations have taken place in other parts of Asia, of course. Choi said that her team has found a formula for Korean and Japanese scripted shows that works for Disney+’s content offer. She added that “heavy scripted” shows with “very complex, strong plot lines,” in genres like action, crime and thriller, work well for the streamer in Asia. Ad-Supported Asia During Disney CEO Bob Iger’s most recent quarterly earnings call, he said that 30% of global Disney+ users are on the ad-supported tier. In the U.S., the figure is slightly higher at 37%. When asked about Disney+’s ad-supported strategy in Asia, given the strategic pivot toward a more premium service with a high average revenue per user (ARPU), Choi said: “Asia is particularly difficult because the markets are so different, so there can’t be one consistent strategy — especially when you look at the basics of growth, whether there is a cable business, where advertisers are spending, and whether it’s efficient for us to offer an ad tier.” Choi added that pricing tiers in Asia also depend on when Disney+ will be “ready to have sports integrated” into its program offerings. Rival streamers such as Netflix have made big moves in live sports. Most recently, the livestream of Mike Tyson and Jake Paul’s boxing match (although not without its tech issues) drew huge audiences, and data exclusively shared with Deadline last week showed that around 11.1 million unique viewers from Asia tuned in live or as-live. Regionally in Asia, Korea’s TVING CEO Choi Ju-hui recently stated that gaining broadcast rights for the KBO, Korea’s top baseball league, has driven huge waves of subscribers to the platform. For Indonesia’s Vidio streaming platform, broadcast rights to the English Premier League as well as UEFA Champions League, among others, are a core part of its growth strategy. With Disney+ adding an ESPN tile to its streaming platform on December 4 and forays into buying live rights to the UEFA Europa League in Denmark and Sweden, it seems that live sports is just on the horizon for Disney+ in Asia, but Choi remained tight-lipped on the streamer’s live sports plans in the region. “We’re not ready to have a specific position on that right at this moment,” said Choi. “In Asia, we know that the first step to try to solidify our base is through local content.” Korea Prospects Across Disney+’s newly-announced titles for its upcoming Korean and Japanese slate, only one title — Tempest — has a female director (Kim Hee-won). In March this year, the Korean Film Council (KOFIC) also released a report noting that among the 35 Korean commercial films released last year — defined as films with a production budget exceeding 3 billion won (US$2.25 million) — only one film was directed by a woman. This film was action thriller The Point Men, directed by Yim Soon-rye. On whether Choi is looking to bring more female directors onboard Disney+ projects, she said: “It has to be the right project. I don’t know if we purposely seek that out. It also depends on particular industry norms. We obviously don’t discriminate. “Many of our projects have strong female writers and writers in the Korean content ecosystem also play a very, very strong role. I know that some of our directors used to be film directors, so maybe those are various contributing factors to why they tend to skew more male, but if there are the right projects or the right opportunities, obviously we’d love to see if we can bring more female directors on board.” She also pointed out that several upcoming Disney+ Korean original titles have female screenwriters, including Hyper Knife (Kim Sun-hee) and Nine Puzzles (Lee Eun-mi). Choi refers to herself as a “Hong Kong-born Chinese.” She told Deadline that Hong Kong films and shows, as well as Japanese content, strongly influenced her taste and sensibilities in entertainment while growing up. She worked for Disney in various roles in China from 2006, then headed up The Walt Disney Company Korea, before being appointed Managing Director of The Walt Disney Company Japan. “I moved out of Hong Kong at the age of 12 and when I first went to the U.S., I struggled to understand why certain things were popular, and I also kept my ties to to Hong Kong and Asia,” said Choi. “If you look at the whole Asian content trend on the movie side, Hong Kong was very dominant and action-filled. On the drama side, Japan was really up there in the ’90s and early 2000s, [with films] like Long Vacation and Tokyo Love Story. I distinctly remember there was this heart-shaped crystal featured in one of the movies that became popular. That has influenced many content creators and storytellers. “Now, you see a lot of those type of influences shifting toward and coming from Korea. Hopefully, we can bring some of that popularity and spread it to other markets beyond Korea. But right now, definitely the trends are being set by Korea.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> International -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Though plot details haven’t been revealed, Lucasfilm has disputed the notion, first suggested by Deadline in their initial report of the forthcoming trilogy, that Kinberg’s movies will continue the story that George Lucas began with 1977’s “A New Hope,” introducing Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia.

As of 12:15 p.m. E.T., Disney’s stock was down 10.4 percent at $104.32, making it one of the stock’s worst days over the past year. While many analysts sounded upbeat notes on several fronts, especially Disney’s moving closer to streaming profitability, the Hollywood conglomerate reported mixed fiscal second-quarter earnings and some near-term challenges, including at theme parks. Newish Disney CFO Hugh Johnston, for example, warned on the earnings call that despite “healthy demand” at parks, “we are seeing some evidence of a global moderation from peak post-COVID travel.” Related Stories All in all, it wasn’t enough to boost bullishness to new heights. And with Disney’s stock up nearly 20 percent so far in 2024 before the earnings update, well ahead of the broad-based S&P 500 stock index’s gain of around 9 percent, it seemed like it would have been too big an ask to beat investors’ expectations so convincingly as to drive the shares even higher right now. Not that there wasn’t a focus on the positive expected later this year. For example, many financial experts highlighted the fact that Disney narrowed its streaming loss to $18 million and even reached a $47 million profit when excluding ESPN+, while reiterating that its streaming division will be in the black in the fiscal fourth quarter, as previously promised, and be a “meaningful future growth driver for the company.” With consistent streaming profitability having long been an elusive goal for entertainment titans, Wall Street observers, in their post-earnings commentary, touched on the success of Disney and CEO Bob Iger, who recently emerged from a bruising proxy battle, in approaching it. The latest streaming improvements also come after an extended struggle to convince analysts that Iger’s overhaul initiatives will pay off. Here is a closer look at Wall Street experts’ key takeaways from Disney’s latest results and forecasts. CFRA Research analyst Kenneth Leon on Tuesday cut his rating on Disney’s stock from “buy” to “hold” and slashed his price target by $23 to $116. “We have less confidence in Disney realizing consistent results in its entertainment and sports units,” he explained. And he highlighted that his new stock price target assumes “a forward total enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 13.4 times, below the three-year historic average at 13.6 times.” Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich reiterated her “buy” rating and $145 price target on Disney’s stock on Tuesday. “Disney reported a solid fiscal second quarter with revenue essentially inline and operating income modestly ahead of our expectations,” she cheered. “The company also raised their fiscal year 2024 earnings per share outlook to 25 percent, versus at least 20 percent previously.” The expert highlighted that Disney’s direct-to-consumer (DTC) did better than she had expected, while traditional TV came in weaker. “DTC outperforms while linear lower than expected,” she concluded in the headline to one of the paragraphs in her report. “Linear networks operating income was $752 million (versus our $800 million) as lower domestic revenue was driven by lower affiliate revenue due to the non-renewal of carriage of certain networks and a decline in advertising revenue attributable to a lower average viewership.” Another gray cloud in the sky was provided by a look at the current quarter. “Disney now expects fiscal third-quarter experiences operating income to be similar to the prior year which implies operating income around $300 million below our current forecast,” she noted. Reif Ehrlich’s overall bullish takeaway: “Disney has a collection of best-in-class premier assets (in content/IP as well as theme parks). Near-term catalysts include: 1) additional updates on strategic priorities for Disney, 2) an inflection in profitability in DTC.” UBS analyst John Hodulik also pointed out mixed trends, but in the headline of his report highlighted: “Earnings per share & free cash flow pacing ahead.” He stuck to his “buy” rating and $140 price target on Disney shares. “DTC was profitable,” excluding ESPN, he wrote. “Management expects softer DTC profits in the fiscal third quarter (UBS estimate: -$52 million) due to Hotstar but profitability in the fiscal fourth quarter. Core Disney+ subscribers increased by 6.3 million (UBS estimate 5.9 million; guide 5.5-6.0 million), including 7.9 million in the U.S. and Canada adds with the Charter deal (UBS estimate 7.5 million). Hulu subs increased by 0.5 million (UBS estimate: flat) versus 1.2 million in the fiscal first quarter.” Hodulik also emphasized Disney’s increased full-year earnings outlook but pointed out “mixed” theme parks commentary that didn’t surprise him too much. “Disney reported stronger earnings per share and in-line revenues, while forward commentary for the parks was mixed due to higher costs from the new cruise ship (similar to previous launches).” Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino maintained his “peer perform” rating without a stock price target in his first take. He highlighted “better results at DTC and sports, and in-line experiences, partially offset by softer linear networks and content/licensing performance.” The expert explained that linear results were “impacted by the non-renewal of carriage of certain networks by Charter,” while the content/licensing business posted a quarterly loss as “revenue came in weaker at $1.39 billion (consensus: $1.51 billion) as there were no significant titles in the current quarter.” Beyond Wall Street, Third Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley also dissected the good and the challenging in Disney’s quarterly results and outlook. “Disney continues to push for streaming profitability and is making substantial progress towards its goal,” he wrote. “A loss of $18 million is a huge improvement for the direct-to-consumer segment that at times has lost over $1 billion a quarter.” He added: “The U.S. streaming market in particular is mature and difficult to navigate, making Disney’s near-8 million Disney+ subscriber adds a very positive sign.” But it’s not all roses. “Disney’s business is facing a few challenges. $2 billion in goodwill impairments driven by Disney’s operations in India and linear business are weighing on results, in addition to the ongoing cord-cutting pressure that will continue to impact Disney’s networks,” warned Lumley. And then there is that old question of who will succeed Iger. “Investors are still looking for clarity on succession planning. We’ve heard from our experts that Dana Walden is the frontrunner for the CEO role, but at this point nothing is set in stone,” highlighted Lumley. “We might not hear any updates until 2025 as Disney’s board makes sure it finds the right candidate for the job.” THR Newsletters Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Investor Relations -> General News & Strategy -> Analyst Perspective"}]}

As Prime Video announced its latest local content slate at a ‘Prime Video Presents India’ showcase, which comprises nearly 70 films and shows, Hopkins told an audience that Indian Prime subscribers were also the most likely to convert to Prime Video — emphasizing how the country has become central to Amazon’s growth internationally. “For the last several years, outside of the U.S. more people have signed up for Prime in India than anywhere else in the world, and in India more people sign up for Prime Video than any other benefit,” said Hopkins. “Last year, India had the highest percentage of Prime Members stream Prime Video than any country in the world.” Prime Video used its showcase to also reveal Indian content is consistently watched in over 210 countries and territories on its service, with Indian programming trending in the Top 10 on Prime Video worldwide for 43 of the last 52 weeks. Watch on Deadline “We look at that next 250 million subscribers that we’re going to acquire, which are definitely going to come from outside the United States. We’re not going to be able to achieve that unless we do a really good job for customers in India, so India is a key geography for us,” Hopkins added. Indeed, India was unaffected by the recent cuts to Prime Video’s international originals efforts and the event today underlined the streamer’s ambitions in the market. The neighboring Southeast Asia-focused Singapore office was significantly reduced, with the original content team axed. Hopkins pointed to the speed of streaming growth in India as an another factor in Amazon’s strategic focus on the country. “When I think about streaming television and I think of India, what’s remarkable is that I’ve heard many people say this week that more people are streaming TV and film than they’re watching it on linear television on satellite cable,” he said. “And what’s remarkable about that is that streaming has only really existed for seven or eight years.” He was talking at an event that attracted Indian celebrities such as Nikhil Advani and Karan Johar, the latter of whom conducted Hopkins’ interview. 69-strong slate Slate announcements at the even comprised 40 original series and 29 films, in several genres in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. This included the Hindi-language series set within the Citadel universe, now titled Citadel: Honey Bunny, starring Varun Dhawan, Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Kay Kay Menon and from Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK, who are also behind comedy drama Gulkanda Tales. as well as a show titled Dupahiya, set in a village that is celebrating 25 years of being crime-free. The Hindi language slate also includes Matka King will follow an enterprising cotton trader in Mumbai who starts a new gambling game called Matka, which surges in popularity in the city, and will be produced by Roy Kapur Films, Aatpat and SMR Productions. Other titles includes alcohol startup drama Daring Partners; unscripted series Follow Karlo Yaar and The Tribe, the latter which is about Indian influencers in LA; Zoya Akhtar, Reema Kagti and Ayesha Sood trans and non-binary doc series In Transit, Indian software industry doc The Great Indian Code. Ranjeen stars Vineet Kumar Singh, Rajshri Deshpande and Taaru Raina, and follow a middle-aged husband confronting an uncomfortable truth. Prime Video is lining up eight features, including Anil Kapoor action drama Subedar. Also on the slate are Adarsh Gaurav-starring comedy Supermen of Malegaon; Indian independence-themed Ae Watan Mere Watan; the Abhishek Bachchan-starrer Be Happy. Uppu Kappu Rambu Cheekati Lo is among the Telugu-language titles. Prime Video is also expanding its reach with younger demographics, developing content suited to their interests. “We also have a fast-growing young adult audience, and we’re really focused on that audience because obviously you’re in India as a young country,” said Hopkins. Young adult titles including Dharmatic Entertainment comedy-drama Call Me Bae, Ankur Tewari and Swanand Kirkire musical Bandwaale, Gen Z drama Ziddi Girls and coming-of-age drama Dil Dosti Dilemma. There will also be a spate of returning series and 29 licensed films. “At Prime Video, it has been our focus to super-serve Indian customers with the best of entertainment across formats. From clutter-breaking Original series and movies, direct-to-service premieres to post-theatrical launches of some of the biggest hits across languages, our goal is to be the first choice of entertainment for every customer,” said Sushant Sreeram, Country Director, Prime Video, India. “Our content broke new grounds in 2023, helping India remain a front runner, across international locales, in new customer adoption and Prime member engagement. We are humbled by the love we have received from our customers, and want every story on our service to be someone’s favourite show or movie. In sync with this, we are thrilled to unveil our biggest, most diverse slate till date, and are certain that our upcoming series and movies will continue to enthrall audiences, not just in India but around the world.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> International -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Amazon’s approach has differed from that of streaming rivals like Netflix, which rolled out a lower-priced tier with ads as an option instead of forcing those who want to stay ad-free to pay extra. Olsavsky was asked about the state of the video ad initiative during a conference call with Wall Street analysts to discuss fourth-quarter earnings. Amazon reported strong financial results in the quarter, beating Wall Street expectations for the holiday period. Overall advertising services revenue, which includes Prime Video, helped drive the quarterly performance with a 27% jump over year-ago levels. Asked to provide a sense of the potential size and scale of the Prime Video ad opportunity, the CFO replied, “I can’t scale it right now. What I would say for ads in video is that advertisers are excited to access our Prime customer base. We’re looking for ways to increase advertising on our streaming properties. ... It’s an important part of the total business model.” Watch on Deadline The management team expects the expansion of advertising to “allow us to have a healthy business, to continue to invest in content and to continue to grow,” Olsavsky continued. “We feel good about it. The way we anticipate ads progressing, it will not have heavy ad loads relative to what you see network TV and others have. Like all of our advertising, we try to be useful to customers.” Many Prime Video viewers have already encountered ads as part of live sports programming, notably NFL Thursday Night Football. The outlet’s embrace of ads is in keeping with an overall industry shift in streaming, which years ago had a pronounced bias toward the ad-free subscription model. Now, as Netflix has sought to stimulate new growth and newer players reckon with the difficult economics of streaming, only Apple TV+ remains (for now) as a general-audience offering without advertising."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Investor Relations -> General News & Strategy -> Quarterly Earnings"}]}

Artisti 7607, which was founded as a co-op more than a decade ago by a group of Italian A-list actors including Elio Germano — who in 2015 won top acting honors in Cannes with Daniele Luchetti’s “Our Life” — has long been doing battle with Netflix over residual rights. “After more than eight years of sterile negotiations to obtain the data necessary to determine the compensation for artists in observance of European and national legislation, Artisti 7607 is forced to appeal to an ordinary court to request compliance with the law,” the indie collecting company said in a statement. Popular on Variety Artisti 7607 is suing Netflix in court after taking similar action with Italy‘s media watchdog AGCOM, which in September 2023 tossed out the collecting company’s case – while acknowledging that Netflix was obliged to provide them viewer data – and urged both parties to negotiate an agreement. “We believe in fair remuneration of performers,” Netflix commented in a statement, noting that they have had an agreement in place with Nuovo Imaie, the largest Italian collecting society representing actors. “We have long tried to reach an agreement with Artisti 7607 and provided them with all information required by law, as recognised by AGCOM in their decision last year,” the streaming giant added. “Artisti 7607 have repeatedly refused our payment offer and, while we remain hopeful that they will accept it, we now await the court’s decision,” Netflix went on to point out. “The very [streaming] platforms that process and exploit data refuse – due to their excessive economic and contractual power – to provide us with data required by law and consequently do not pay artists their fees,” Germano said in a statement released by Artisti 7607 on Tuesday. Another popular Italian film and TV actor, Neri Marcorè, pointed out that Artisti 7607 are taking legal action against the U.S. streaming giant for the same reasons that prompted the recent actors’ and writers’ strikes in Hollywood. “We all demand transparency of data on the exploitation of audiovisual works and adequacy of compensation,” he said. The Artisti 7607 statement also noted that the European Union’s Copyright Directive, approved in 2019, “has made it clear that artists’ remuneration must be ‘adequate and proportionate’ to revenues.” But according to local experts, the thorny issue is more complex and clearly remains unresolved in Italy, making this case a potential local landmark."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strategy & Miscellaneous News -> General News & Strategy -> Misc.

Last week, Sony Block Solutions Labs, a joint venture between the Japanese conglomerate’s former Sony Network Communications Labs unit and Startale Labs, a Sony company established for the express purpose of “building new network infrastructure using blockchain technology, said that it has developed the Soneium blockchain as the infrastructure network on which the company wants “to accelerate Web3 innovation.” Related Stories “While the Internet has contributed to improving convenience worldwide, it has led to the centralization of a huge amount of information and the economic sphere online,” Sony said. “Web3 makes it possible to decentralize that concentrated power. Today, Web3 faces two challenges: the current community of Web3 technology and services is limited to a few core users and there are numerous use cases that have yet to gain the traction to go mainstream with the general public. The creation of killer use cases is eagerly awaited.” On Wednesday morning Tokyo time, early L.A. evening time, Sony said it was launching the “Soneium Minato” public testnet and an “ambitious” developer incubation program dubbed “Soneium Spark” to “catalyze ecosystem growth and accelerate adoption by leveraging its vast global reach and technological expertise across [the] entertainment, gaming, and consumer electronics sectors.” The two initiatives will work hand-in-hand with developers. “While the testnet offers a robust environment for building and testing decentralized applications, Soneium Spark supercharges project growth through expert mentorship, cutting-edge infrastructure access, and strategic industry partnerships,” the company said. It also highlighted strategic partnerships with Web3 companies that are set to benefit the push, including with Astar Network, formerly known as Plasm and a decentralized blockchain platform for Web3, service and financial tech platform Circle, Web3 collective Optimism, development platform Alchemy, The Graph, which indexes blockchain data and makes it more easily accessible, and services platform Chainlink. Importantly, Sony subsidiaries, such as its film and music units, will participate in the incubation program. “We have opened our testnet as a first step to foster a fan community centered on creators that can connect diverse values through Soneium,” said Jun Watanabe, chairman of Sony Block Solution Labs. “Let’s work together to create new value in Web3 toward a world where Web3 services are used in people’s daily life.” Among Web3 apps that have attracted users include the likes of Flickplay, which allows users to unlock digital assets and create videos with them using augmented reality (AR). But doubters have said that the sector has yet to prove its viability. X owner and executive chairman Elon Musk in late 2021 famously argued that Web3 “seems more marketing buzzword than reality right now.” Critics have also expressed concern that in a decentralized internet it would be harder to prevent crime and hate speech or warned of a blockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFTs bubble.

The studio has signed first-look deals with nine writers and comics — Scott Aukerman, Karen Chee, Shaun Diston, Chris Garcia, Chris Gethard, Lisa Gilroy, Lacey Jeka, Julie Klausner and Alok Vaid-Menon. They’ll all work on developing new comedy series projects and potentially collaborate with other writers and producers who have deals at Sony. Lauren Stein, head of creative at Sony Pictures TV, and Colin Davis, executive vp comedy development, said the deals are part of an effort at the studio to bring in what Davis calls a “spectrum of sensibilities” to comedy development. Related Stories “The list is a collective of a different creators and multihyphenates that we believe each have unique voices and a hit show in them,” Davis said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “They really represent the comedy community at large, and we’re excited that we get to be the third-party studio that gets to sell what their visions are to a variety of places.” Stein told THR that the deals are also a signal to “come play” at the studio: “It’s our way of saying, ‘Come here.’ You’re not tied down here because it’s just a first look. You still have the flexibility to work at other places, staff on other shows. But bring us those passion projects. Bring us the idea that you don’t think you could get another studio to do. Because of our independence, we have the most flexibility, and you’ll get the most freedom for your creativity.” The nine people in this wave of deals are a mix of more established writers and performers like Gethard (The Chris Gethard Show), Aukerman (Comedy Bang! Bang!) and Klausner (Difficult People, Schmigadoon!), and up-and-comers like Vaid-Menon (Netflix’s Gender Agenda comedy special) and actor-writers Gilroy and Jeka (who, incidentally, have worked with Aukerman and Gethard, respectively, in the past). Chee is a three-time Emmy nominee as part of the Late Night With Seth Meyers writing staff; Diston has penned episodes of Peacock’s Twisted Metal and Hulu’s Woke; and Garcia is a writer and co-producer on Sony and Fox’s new animated series Universal Basic Guys. After signing the first-looks, the writers were encouraged to meet and talk with other writers and producers who are based at Sony. “For us, it’s important for the creative process for people to meet and talk — you don’t know where an idea is going to come from,” said Stein. “A producer may have an idea that a writer has a very specific connection to — you only learn those things by having people meet.” Davis also noted that Gethard has already started working with Jessi Klein (Dead to Me, Big Mouth), who has an existing deal at Sony, on an idea. Like most other studios, Sony has in recent years pushed to mine its IP library for reboots and updates on titles like CBS’ SWAT and Netflix/Pop TV’s One Day at a Time. The incoming writers — all of whom have pretty specific sensibilities — will be free to come up with new takes on Sony-owned properties, but they’ll also be encouraged to develop original ideas. “It’s not a move away from [IP],” Stein said of the new deals. “I think it’s just a broadening out. There’s no mandate, so if you have an original idea, great. If you have an idea that is based on existing IP that we have, that’s OK too. We don’t tell people that you have to be original or you have to base it on something.” THR Newsletters Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Deals -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Take the case of the red-hot “Wuthering Heights” package. The Emerald Fennell-directed film, which will star Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, sparked a bidding war, with Netflix’s $150 million offer dwarfing Warner Bros.’ $80 million bid. For the past decade, agents have advised their clients to take the loot. But in a sign of the turning tide, the “Wuthering Heights” filmmakers, led by producer Robbie, opted for Warners film chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy’s pitch for a wide theatrical release and a full marketing campaign. One top agent says Netflix was “shocked” by the outcome “because obviously they had outbid [every other studio] for so long,” and had been used to winning these contests. Even more surprising: Netflix may not have even finished the heat in second. Amazon is believed to have done so, having promised Fennell a major theatrical push. (Netflix and Amazon declined comment.) Popular on Variety For its part, Warners was eager to move forward immediately. Production begins in first-quarter 2025, sources say, even if that poses a logistical headache for Elordi, who is scheduled to begin shooting “Euphoria” Season 3 in January for sister company HBO. (Warners also declined comment.) “Netflix has the biggest number of subscribers and scale, so they can afford to play the game that they’re playing,” says Eric Handler, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners. “But there’s a growing contingent of directors and movie stars who are saying, ‘No thanks.’” Now, some filmmakers who signed deals with Netflix appear to be having second thoughts about the company’s no-to-cursory theatrical stance and are looking for any wiggle room. In 2020, Greta Gerwig inked a lucrative pact to write and direct two films for the streamer based on C.S. Lewis’ “The Chronicles of Narnia” book series. But that was before the mega-success of Gerwig’s “Barbie” and its $1.45 billion box office haul. With “Barbie” star Robbie having bypassed Netflix on “Wuthering Heights,” Gerwig has renewed leverage and is in discussions to see “Narnia” receive an Imax run when it is released in 2026. A source familiar with the dealmaking says talks are preliminary for “Narnia” to screen at most of the roughly 1,800 Imax theaters globally, but the specific footprint has not been discussed in detail. Another source says the film will only unspool across a fraction of Imax theaters. Another key detail being ironed out is the time between the Imax run and the Netflix bow. A truncated window could prove thorny for Imax. “AMC, Regal, Cinemark and any of the partners who have Imax screens are not going to be happy to put money into promoting a movie that you could see on Netflix a week later,” Handler says. Last month, Imax poached Jonathan Fischer from Netflix to be its chief content officer. Fischer — who was Netflix’s VP of content strategy and analysis, global films — is said to be heavily involved in finding a middle ground for all of the “Narnia” parties. But Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos indicated during a recent earnings call that he isn’t inclined to budge on windowing and insisted that Netflix films are culturally relevant. “We believe that not making [subscribers] wait for months to watch the movie that everyone’s talking about adds that value. So what we do for filmmakers is we bring them the biggest audience in the world for their films. And then we help them make the best films of their life,” Sarandos said. “I’m sure that we can continue to pierce the zeitgeist and have those moments in the culture even when those moments begin on Netflix.” All the while, talent continues to navigate a leadership change at Netflix that saw Scott Stuber step down as film chief and Dan Lin fill the post. Agents say the shuffle likely didn’t play a role in the streaming giant losing out to Warners on “Wuthering Heights,” nor is it significant in the “Narnia” talks. What the “Narnia” window ultimately will be remains to be seen, but some see Netflix as approaching a slippery slope. “If they break precedent for one, then what?” says Peter Newman, head of the MBA/MFA graduate dual degree program at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. “Who’s to say that a director who’s worth three-quarters as much as Greta in the public’s mind shouldn’t ask for the same? It will be very hard to keep that discipline.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Film -> General News & Strategy"}]}

Earlier this year, as Amazon was making cuts across its entertainment businesses during a major round of international restructuring, Ordonez was named head of Prime Video EU Emerging — a cluster of countries Amazon had identified as the new growth drivers in Europe that would sit opposite a group of countries on the continent where Prime Video is a household name. Internally, staff were told that investment was coming to Benelux, the CEE and the Nordics, with Africa and the Middle East the unfortunate hubs that would lose out as a result. In her first interview since the move, Ordonez doesn’t comment on how the changes played out but instead outlines her vision for the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, Turkey and Poland — though she is essentially general manager of all European territories outside of the UK, Germany, Italy, France and Spain. Within Amazon, her unit is now being referred to as EU Expansion (EUX), perhaps a clearer indicator of the direction of travel. However, Ordonez has, in fact, effectively been working on the initiative since June 2020, when she relocated from the U.S. to Munich, Germany, to oversee marketing in the EU Expansion countries. She was upped to a general manager post two years later and took control of Benelux, the CEE and Turkey — and has since focused on investing in countries where Prime Video has acted as a trigger for Prime retail subscriptions. Watch on Deadline Moving money from the MENA region and Africa — “rebalancing” resources as Prime Video’s VP & GM for EMEA, Barry Furlong, awkwardly put it to staff at the time — left local producers in those regions disappointed to lose a key buyer just as it was getting started. Indeed, Amazon had struck deals in Africa with the likes of Inkblot Studios and Jáde Osiberu and launched its first original, Gangs of Lagos, in 2023 as part of what had been described to Deadline as “continued, long-term investment in sub-Saharan Africa.” Once the dust had settled, Prime Video began using the transferred cash to increase local acquisitions and originals in the EUX territories. Accordingly, Ordonez fronted a ‘Prime Video Presents...’ showcase in Poland just last week. So why haven’t we heard more from her? The answer is simply because she’s been in the background, squirrelling away on strategy and overseeing developments in areas such as UX, dubbing and acquisitions. “We have been in a pure building stage over the last two years,” Ordonez tells Deadline. “The change for me this year is taking on the Nordics and the bifurcation of the European business. We found a lot consistency in some of the playbooks across territories and have experimented on how we could scale that to meet our content needs, but in a sustainable way.” Amazon’s European ride Prime Video has been in Europe, in one form or another, since it acquired UK DVD rentals and streaming service Lovefilm in 2011. A global launch followed almost exactly eight years ago on December 14, 2016, and the SVoD became a key player in the streaming arms race that followed. Earlier this year, Amazon’s move to downsize its entertainment business and cut costs saw Europe split in two, with Ordonez leading emerging territories and Brigitte Ricou-Bellan taking on the established UK, Germany, Spain, Italy and France, known as EU5. Though the expansion cluster received new investment, we revealed Amazon was axing just under 5% of its Prime Video Europe staff in the restructing. Amazon hasn’t directly commented on the specifics of the layoffs. Ordonez says she and the UK-based Ricou-Bellan are “attached at the hip” as they work through the next stages of Prime Video’s European adventure. Neither come from content backgrounds — Ordonez came up through marketing and Bellan-Ricou through a boardroom-focused career. “We work very closely together — I spend more time with her than I do my husband,” jokes Ordonez. However, she acknowledges that the “much more mature” EU5 is on a “very different journey” with more robust content investments. “We realized we needed a very different playbook.” The necessity to write the rules of a new “playbook” is obvious. Streaming in Europe has changed significantly over recent years, as studios refocus on profitability over subs growth. Paramount+ and HBO Max (now Max) both rowed back from local commissioning pushes, and while Netflix, Amazon and Disney continued with originals, the order book is more scrutinized than ever. Last week, HBO boss Casey Bloys told journalists in London that Max is back in the market for European originals, but it isn’t yet clear exactly how that will play out. For Prime Video’s EUX business, which Ordonez notes is providing “all meaningful growth in Europe,” the challenge is clear. “There is a game to win in these countries,” she says. “Our goal is to grow sustainably with a path to profitability. These are meaningful countries, but they’re smaller than EU5, so it’s about looking at bespoke content needs. It’s about giving the customers the same robust content slate, but with more efficient ways of building that.” In Poland, the most nascent of Prime Video EUX’s key territories, last week signalled a big moment, with a content showcase featuring docs about singer Doda and Polish soccer star Wojciech Szczęsny, new unscripted shows Rap Generation and The 50 and further details on Season 3 of comedy reality show LOL: Last One Laughing. “People forget that we are there because we’ve been working in the background, so this is something of our debut, and our chance to highlight the content we are making,” says Ordonez. “I hope people walked away understanding that. “It’s only really the last two years we’ve been doing originals in Poland. It’s the newest for us from an investment perspective, along with Turkey, and there’s still lots to learn. We’re really early in our journey, but it’s exciting and it’s what I love about Amazon: I never would have thought I’d live in Europe or have this kind of role.” The advantage for Prime Video EUX is it has been “able to learn what is working in other territories,” says Ordonez. For example, Japanese format LOL: Last One Laughing (aka Documental) has been remade across the Prime Video footprint, including in the Nordics where there are versions in Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and the Netherlands. “We know comedy is a great way to tap into the local audience and it complements what we have on the scripted side of our global slate,” she adds. Notable shows from the Netherlands include Jorik, a doc that tells the story of notorious Dutch rapper and actor Jorik Scholten (aka Lil’ Kleine), and comedy series De Tatta’s, about a rich family who find themselves broke. From Turkey are the likes of Blue Cave (Mavi Magara), about a Navy soldier who makes a trip to honor his late wife, while the Nordic region has spawned the likes of sport sod Ingebritsen – Born to Run, crime drama STHLM Blackout and Q1 2025 will see the launch of mystery drama series Blindspar (Blind Spot) and The Commoner. Program licensing and pay-one film acquisitions have also been a key in the Nordics, Netherlands, Poland and Turkey with the audience in the latter particularly keen on local scripted movies. In the Nordics, the acquisition of nine Viaplay originals — comprising Bullshit, The Commoner, The Fortress, In the Name of Love, Jana – Marked for Life, Paradis City, Solo/Dancing Alone, Furia Season Two and Those Who Kill Season Four — was “a great way to add scripted to the slate and build a robust offer there,” says Ordonez. This came after Viaplay pulled out of the production game. The plan for originals in each country Ordonez looks after is around six to eight per year, though that could be lower in Turkey, where inflation has meant it is “challenging trying to calibrate investments,” she says. “Having around that number again helps us to complement that global slate with some local flavor, and that’s fairly consistent in most territories.” Testing models Anyone who’s been to a TV industry event or has been reading Deadline’s international coverage in the past year will know co-productions are becoming increasingly the norm at global streamers, as they seek to find ways to adapt their slates while not breaking the bank. For Prime Video EUX, this is an option that’s being explored. “The reality is we’re open,” says Ordonez. “We know we have to work leaner in those countries, so we’re pretty flexible on the models. We have co-produced in the Nordics and partnered with broadcasters in the Netherlands.” Beyond that, EUX will follow the model Prime Video has established elsewhere, for example, looking to aggregate other services (Max is offered in the Netherlands and SkyShowtime in Poland) or add more networks to Prime Video Channels. Movies and series offered via rental are also offered to make …"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> International -> General News & Strategy"}]}

By last fall, he’d changed his mind, declaring them not for sale. On interviews and earnings calls since, he’s explained why — most recently at the MoffettNathanson media conference, and in the midst of annual upfront presentations to advertisers. “When I came back, I did declare that everything was on the table. Meaning I wanted to look at our asset base as a company and determine whether we were supporting assets that not only had no growth but were drags on our bottom line. I looked very extensively at traditional media. It was exhaustive in terms of our analysis. And ultimately, we concluded that ... it’s not going to be a growth business, but it could become an important component to our ability to basically engage with the consumer,” Iger said during a Q&A Wednesday. Watch on Deadline The key, he said, “is basically to reduce pretty dramatically our investment in content, specifically aimed at those traditional networks. Invest in some, but then manage the traditional platforms, networks, and the streaming platforms, seamlessly. So you’ve got the same executives managing both.” He’s referring to Dana Walden, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, who oversees the company’s full portfolio of entertainment media, news and content businesses globally, including streaming, and Jimmy Pitaro, chair of ESPN and sports, which is now one of three standalone Disney divisions. “Their goal is to drive bottom line growth. So you would put something on ABC —Grey’s Anatomy, Abbott Elementary — and it goes on Hulu pretty quickly. In some cases, it’s simultaneous. And what we’re getting is an unduplicated audience” with ABC skewing older and Hulu younger. “We’re basically aggregating a greater audience, and we’re amortizing costs.” Iger said the company is doing that across the board from Disney Channel to ABC to National Geographic, “and it’s working.” “We’re going to continue to see erosion ... for those businesses, but we’re going to actually continue to drive profitability because we’re managing our costs so effectively ... And I think they’ll play an important role.” “We feel comfortable with our hands right now, because we’re using those networks efficiently and effectively.” Earlier this week, Iger took the stage at the Disney/ABC upfront presentation for the first time since 1994, musing on how things have changed. “For instance, television used to be something you watched on a television.” But he said “success in this industry is really predicated on one thing, and that is telling great stories ...

Popular on Variety The Hindi-language lineup includes renowned filmmaker Sooraj Barjatya (“Uunchai”) making his streaming debut with “Badaa Naam Karenge,” a family drama that is due to premiere during the Diwali holiday frame in November. “That’s a big one for us,” Khan says. Sudhir Mishra directs “Summer of 77,” a university-set series dealing with romance and friendship with the Indian political emergency of 1975-77 as a backdrop. Barun Sobti and Anjali Anand star in “Raat Jawan Hai,” a modern and quirky show that deals with contemporary issues, and another family drama “Civil Lines,” from Durgesh Singh, the writer of hit SonyLIV show “Gullak.” Previously announced Hindi-language shows include Nikkhil Advani’s political drama “Freedom at Midnight,” based on the book by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins; suspense thriller “36 Days”; Ram Madhvani’s Indian freedom movement-based “Waking of a Nation”; “Kan Khajura,” the Indian adaptation of Israel’s “Magpie”; second seasons of “Tanaav” and “Chamak”; and third seasons of “Undekhi” and “Gullak.” The Telugu-language lineup includes: historical action-drama series “Lords of the Deccan,” in association with Rana Daggubati’s Spirit Media, adapted from the bestseller, “Lords of The Deccan: Southern India from Chalukyas to Cholas” by Anrirudh Kanisetti; and female cop story “Brinda,” starring Trisha Krishnan, which weaves in a strong element of the folklore of Andhra Pradesh.

The content focus is also expanding to include young adult and Indian family stories, Khan said, adding, “You will see esports being a very strong pillar of us reaching out to a younger set of people and we are also creating a tournament, which we believe will be a very big one as far as the esports community is concerned in India.” Among unscripted shows, “MasterChef India” in the Hindi language was a big success for SonyLIV as was “Shark Tank India.” Tamil and Telugu-language versions of “MasterChef India” are due in 2024, as is season 3 of “Shark Tank India.” More unscripted shows are on the way, including international adaptations and homegrown ones, including quiz show “Quizzer of the Year,” hosted by veteran Indian quizmaster Siddhartha Basu, co-designed and co-created with Anita Kaul Basu. SonyLIV has some 33 million subscribers, mostly from deploying the B2C or business-to-consumer model. This number is on the rise as the streamer belatedly entered the bundling model with B2B or business-to-business deals in India, Bangladesh, Southeast Asia and the Middle East with partners including OTT Play, Watcho, Times Prime, Airtel, Jio and Vi. “We are expecting some real growth between January and March. The one thing that has added or accelerated our subscription growth is B2B bundling, which was delayed for us,” Khan said. India is a market led by content consumption on mobile devices, aided by some of the cheapest data rates in the world. “Telcos help us to reach out to a set of people who are very heterogeneously distributed across India and otherwise would have cost us high in terms of cost of acquisition and marketing cost. And it’s a win win for us and the telcos,” Khan said. The next big push for SonyLIV is in the U.S. and U.K. markets. In the U.S. the service is available via Sling TV. “SonyLIV has not been distributed in the U.S., which is a big market,” Khan said. “We have a deal with Sling TV till about end of March. We are looking forward to having a more stronger presence in the U.S. market from April onwards, where we’ll see a little bit of a stronger marketing effort and launching a more B2C product there.” “We have been in the process of building what we think will be an impactful show proposition because there are so many shows being launched, how do we break through? So one of the thoughts is that if we can find some really strong shows in different languages, we can really go out in the U.K. and U.S.,” Khan added."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> International -> General News & Strategy"}]}

We can’t wait to work with Adam to bring this story to the screen.” Plantinga called news of the acquisition “fantastic,” even if his daughters “won’t be impressed unless the book becomes a ride at Universal Studios and not just any ride, but the best ride.” For his part, he is “greatly looking forward to the prospect of Universal Television bringing the book to screen.” Previously, Plantinga has published two acclaimed works of nonfiction, the first being 400 Things Cops Know, which was nominated for an Agatha Award and won the 2015 Silver Falchion award for best nonfiction crime reference. He followed up that work, hailed as “truly excellent” by author Lee Child, with 2018’s Police Craft. Plantinga began his career in law enforcement in 2001, serving as a police officer in Milwaukee before moving over to the San Francisco Police Department, where he currently serves as a sergeant assigned to street patrol. One of the world’s leading television studios, Universal Television has been behind everything from Hacks and Girls5Eva to The Gilded Age and Schmigadoon!. Also home to Dick Wolf’s Law & Order, One Chicago and FBI-branded series, its other recent series include Bel-Air, Never Have I Ever, The Best Man: The Final Chapters, The Equalizer, Loot, Harlem and Bupkis, to name a few. Plantinga is represented by Independent Artist Group and Caitlin Blasdell at Liza Dawson Associates."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> TV -> Development"}]}

Paramount is currently in exclusive negotiations with Skydance on a potential merger, but there is another contender lurking — one coming from way out of left field. The New York Times reported Thursday that Sony Pictures Entertainment is in talks with Apollo Global Management on teaming up for a potential joint bid to buy Paramount. There has not been an official offer on the table because of the formal exclusive negotiations, but this one threatens to be seismic. There is one degree of separation between the potential joint venture: Sony and the Apollo-backed Legendary Pictures already have a distribution deal. When reached by IndieWire, Sony had no comment on the report. Same with Paramount, and Apollo did not immediately respond to our inquiry. We get it: we’re sort of speechless too. A Sony Pictures and Paramount Pictures studio combination would be an instant Hollywood juggernaut. (So much so that the DOJ and other government entities could have something to say about it.) And yes, further consolidation in Hollywood is expected — David Zaslav, who just got the M&A handcuffs off (but still carries a major debt load) had a cup of coffee with Paramount over a potential alliance — but that doesn’t make Sony-Paramount make sense. Sony made a conscious decision in 2019 to get out of the streaming business, selling its Crackle to Chicken Soup for the Soul. Sony knew it could never scale Crackle to compete with Netflix, Hulu, and other emerging streamers (Disney+ launched later that year). Instead of chasing Netflix like everyone else, Sony essentially became an “arms dealer” for the platform, producing and licensing its content to Netflix from the relative safety of the sidelines in the streaming wars. (Sony still has a theatrical-release strategy, but their output deal makes Netflix the first stop for the streaming window.) It’s better to be there than the frontlines — just ask Paramount+, which is still losing hundreds of millions of dollars each quarter. The Sony strategy has generally worked. In the most recently reported quarter, Sony Pictures’ profit soared 56 percent to $281 million. “Grow-or-die” was so two years ago; just make money, baby. Many analysts believe Paramount+ should have never launched, and that it should shutter now. They see the same arms dealer strategy as the better one for Paramount Pictures. In that sense, the combination of the companies starts making a little more sense. What to do with Paramount+ may be the least of a buyer’s concern. You know what’s an even worse business to get into in 2024 than streaming? Broadcast and cable TV, which is where Paramount Global has a huge presence. What would Sony want with CBS, let alone MTV, VH1, Comedy Central, BET, Nickelodeon, etc.? It is Paramount’s TV and streaming business that put it in the vulnerable position to be acquired in the first place. Sony does make some TV shows, but its best ones are game shows like “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune.” Syndication is great, but synergy is better. (Tony Vinciquerra, the chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment whom the New York Times says has been involved in the conversations with Apollo, has experience in the TV space having previously worked at both Fox and CBS.) Finally, it would admittedly be cool to own the iconic Paramount Pictures lot in Hollywood, sure, but Sony’s own studio lot is just 10 miles down the 10 (with some Wilshire in the way). The reality is just because you buy something doesn’t mean you have to keep it. The M.O. of private-equity firms like Apollo is to unlock value, which often means stripping the car for its parts. Paramount’s TV and streaming assets would likely be the first to go. If anybody would buy them (for a decent price), Sony (and Apollo) may have something here. Apollo first tried (on its own) to buy Paramount’s studio assets for $11 billion. No go: Shari Redstone, who controls Paramount Global through her National Amusements Inc. voting shares, has been hesitant to sell off the crown jewel. Apollo came back with $26 billion to buy the entire company. But Paramount’s board, according to the New York Times, had questions about whether Apollo had the financing to back up such an offer (a feeling Byron Allen is familiar with) and instead focused on Skydance’s offer, which was further down the road in conversations. David Ellison is attempting to buy National Amusements itself for a much smaller purchase price, then leverage that corporate control to merge his Skydance with Paramount. Having Sony, a $100-billion company (by market cap, where Paramount Global is worth just $8 billion), on board certainly helps calm financial fears. Sony is also Skydance on steroids. The NYT says the Apollo-Sony deal would be an all-cash offer for Paramount stock, and would effectively take the company private. It could mean Apollo gets a minority stake in the joint company, with Sony being the majority holder and operating the combined studios. There’s still a chance Sony and Apollo don’t make a bid at all. By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

Starting July 10, the entertainment giant will launch “In The Arena: Serena Williams,” a new eight-part miniseries that chronicles the tennis legend’s long career, including perspective from the subject herself as well as that from key figures in her life. The program is backed by Morgan Stanley, which serves as a presenting sponsor of the series, and TJ Maxx and Heineken, which have come on board as associate sponsors. With its sponsorship, Morgan Stanley sees a chance to throw a bigger spotlight on women’s sports overall, says Alice Milligan, the company’s chief marketing officer. The category only gets a small investment from advertisers, she says, yet is expected to become a more than $1 billion industry, according to a recent report from Deloitte. Popular on Variety The financial-services giant sees an opportunity to show itself as having “old school grit” but “new world vision,” she says, and “I can’t think of anyone more gritty or visionary than Serena herself.” Between July 10 and August 28, Morgan Stanley will sponsor elements within the ESPN+ series, including custom vignettes and logo bugs; social posts from ESPN that appear across Instagram and Facebook; and promos for the miniseries that appear in shows such as “First Take,” “Get Up” and “SportsCenter.” Big sports-media outlets have given the bulk of their attention to games dominated by male athletes and owners. As streaming-video disrupts the traditional economics of entertainment, however, some media companies are putting a new focus on female sports, hoping that these games can draw bigger crowds – and the money that would presumably come with them. Advertisers put more than $18 million against ESPN’s NCAA women’s basketball tournament, playoffs and championship in 2022, according to Vivvix, a tracker of ad spending. Top advertisers included Nissan, Capital One and Unilever’s Degree deodorant. GroupM, the large media-buying consortium backed by ad giant WPP, vowed earlier this year to double the amount of money its clients spend on women’s sports in 2024 and said it would seek to create a dedicated marketplace for the programming genre, starting in the industry’s next “upfront” negotiation period. The firm has already secured interest from advertisers including adidas, Ally, Coinbase, Discover, Google, Mars, Nationwide, Unilever and NBCUniversal’s Universal Pictures. “Disney has been in this game for a long time, and we are hoping that brands are coming to help us continue the mission we have had for many years,” says Mike Denby, senior vice president of sales for Disney Advertising. The series is directed by Gotham Chopra, co-directed by Lauren Fisher, and co-produced by ESPN, Religion of Sports, Tom Brady’s 199 Productions, and Williams and Caroline Currier’s Nine Two Six Productions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content, Deals & Distribution -> Sports -> General News & Strategy"}]}

With about a year’s worth of regulatory review and preparation ahead of the projected third-quarter 2025 closing date, Ellison affirmed during a call with reporters that the three-member Office of the CEO at Paramount will continue reviewing assets. Along with identifying candidates for sale, the management team is also discussing potential streaming partnerships and joint ventures in the U.S. and internationally. “It is important that the company not be paralyzed in any way, shape or form,” Ellison said when asked how the company would proceed if opportunities arise in the coming months. Skydance would have a “voice” in any deliberations, he added, but would need to defer to the Co-CEOs on the main strategic decisions given the need to avoid tripping any regulatory alarms. Watch on Deadline Jeff Shell, the chairman of sports and media for Skydance backer RedBird Capital and future president of Paramount Global, fielded a similar question during a call earlier Monday with investors. “As far as asset sales, yeah, I mean, there are assets,” he said. “We’ve taken a bottom up approach. As I said, David and I and the team, for the whole asset, the whole portfolio. There are assets here which we think are not strategic to where we’re going, that if we were to get a buyer to pay a price that we thought was compelling, we would absolutely do that. And, you know, I know current management is also talking about a couple of transactions that if they get the right price, will be supportive of us so on that for sure.” While no specific assets were called out by execs, the company has been in talks with potential buyers of BET and had already been taking a closer look at a number of properties, including ad-supported streaming outlet Pluto TV.

Among some of Boxer’s highlights at Amazon, he oversaw the specialty theatrical releases of such Oscar nominated titles as Being the Ricardos, Poland’s 2018 International film entry Cold War, and 2x Oscar winner Sound of Metal. With Amazon’s acquisition of MGM, Boxer was a key suit in getting Ben Affleck’s Air into theaters. He was also recently involved in the successful release strategies for awards season titles Saltburn, The Boys in the Boat and American Fiction. During the pandemic, Boxer also handled the theatrical distribution of such big Prime Video acquisition titles, Coming 2 America, Cinderella, Hotel Transylvania 4, and The Tomorrow War to those cinemas and drive-ins that were lucky to be open. Watch on Deadline Boxer also supervised the opening, and operated Amazon’s Culver Theater in Culver City, CA; the venue the studio took over from Arclight Cinemas. One innovative stunt Boxer spearheaded was “Prime Premiere” nights at theaters. It was a one-night-only, once a month theatrical showing of series and movies, free to Prime Members. Those Prime members who visited the theater were treated to free popcorn, soda as well as a gift. Boxer was tapped by then Amazon Head of Marketing and Distribution, Bob Berney, in September 2017. The New York-based film industry vet was an integral part of three different theatrical distribution phases at Amazon. When Boxer arrived from IFC Films where he served as their EVP of Sales and Distribution, the fresh mandate for Amazon was to self-distribute its own theatrical titles; the studio previously relying on distribution partners such as Lionsgate, STX, Annapurna and Bleecker Street. As such, Boxer pioneered Amazon’s theatrical distribution in-house strategy, protecting theatrical windows on mid-budget and specialty fare. The exec oversaw a slate of some 12-14 titles initially that included Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, Luca Guadagnino’s Suspiria, Gus Van Sant’s Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot, Mike Leigh’s Peterloo and Felix van Groeningen’s Beautiful Boy. In late 2019 after a buying spree by Amazon at Sundance which included such titles as the Adam Driver political crime drama The Report, the company began adapting to a truncated theatrical window strategy, and in some cases a day-and-date with Prime Video release pattern. In fact, it was that type of dynamic distribution model Boxer pioneered during his tenure at IFC Films with such movies as Oscar nominee In the Loop. Then, beginning in 2023, in the wake of the MGM purchase by the streamer, Boxer was a part of Amazon Studios’ return to a lengthy theatrical window, working on such movies as Air, Saltburn, American Fiction and Boys in the Boat. At IFC Films, Boxer handled the theatrical release of Richard Linklater’s Oscar winner, Boyhood, as well as the non-theatrical, Canadian distribution and overall theatrical distribution of all IFC labels, including Sundance Selects and IFC Midnight. Throughout his career, and including his run at Amazon MGM, Boxer has had a big presence at film festivals, assessing product. Boxer began his distribution career as a regional booker at Victor Kaufman and Lewis Korman’s Savoy Pictures where he booked such movies as Minnie Driver’s breakout Circle of Friends and Robert De Niro’s directorial debut Bronx Tale. Among Boxer’s mentors were the late Jimmy Spitz, who was Savoy’s distribution chief, as well as Steve Rothenberg, and John Gruenberg. After Savoy, Boxer’s career flourished at Sony where he distributed several wide releases during the late ’90s, and then Artisan Entertainment where he covered Central and East Coast film distribution and sales for 50-plus markets. Boxer handled distribution on Artisan’s 1999 breakout hit The Blair Witch Project ($140.5M)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Org -> Exec Changes"}]}
