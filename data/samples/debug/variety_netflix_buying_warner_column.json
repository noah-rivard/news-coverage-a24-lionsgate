  "content": "A Variety column argues that Netflix's plan to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery would turn one of Hollywood's legacy studios into a streaming content mill. Producers and theater owners fear Netflix would favor direct-to-platform releases, shrinking Warner's theatrical slate and squeezing midbudget films that keep crews working. The piece compares the potential fallout to Disney's purchase of 20th Century Fox, which reduced output and jobs across marketing and distribution. While Ted Sarandos has promised to keep franchises like DC and Harry Potter in theaters, skeptics note Netflix has historically offered only limited theatrical windows and invests less in cinema-first campaigns. The column contends that losing an independent Warner Bros. would erode competition, reduce creative risk-taking and accelerate the collapse of the traditional studio system."
