  "content": "Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery drew an immediate rebuke from the Writers Guild of America. In a Dec. 5 letter to the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, WGA West president Meredith Stiehm argued the deal would slash jobs, depress wages and concentrate leverage over talent. The guild noted that writers have already lost residual income as streaming reshaped the labor market and warned that removing a major buyer would further erode pay. Leaders also highlighted Netflix's large share of viewing and Warner Bros.' deep library, saying a combined company would wield outsized power to set terms for creatives and consumers. Pointing to disruptions after the 2022 Warner-Discovery tie-up, the guild urged regulators to block the transaction outright and vowed to fight for divestitures and strict conditions if it advances."
